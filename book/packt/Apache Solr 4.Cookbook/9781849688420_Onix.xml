      <BiographicalNote>Don Rudder is the Director of Software Development at CASE and focuses on the creation and management of specialized software and add-ons for various applications developed for client support. With over 16 years of experience in the AEC industry, Don has served well over 10 of those years as an HVAC and electrical designer for various MEP firms. He later began to focus more heavily on software development and related support where he eventually ended up in San Francisco serving as BIM Manager for HOK. Self-taught in some 14 programming languages and well versed in .NET, web-based AEC tools, and pretty much any kind of Automation, Don has presented at Autodesk University and the Revit Technology Conference of North America. Don has been the contributing author of the API chapters for Mastering Autodesk Revit Architecture 2011, "Mastering Autodesk Revit Architecture 2012, and Mastering Autodesk Revit Architecture 2013". I would like to thank my rock star friends and co-workers at CASE for just being awesome and bringing me into their mix. Without them, I would probably still be buried too deep in insignificant obligations without any real time to share stuff like what's in this book.</BiographicalNote>
