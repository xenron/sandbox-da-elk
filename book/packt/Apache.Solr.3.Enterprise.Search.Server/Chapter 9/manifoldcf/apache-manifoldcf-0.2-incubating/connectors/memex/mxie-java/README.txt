The Memex connector is no longer distributed at the request of Memex, who
is now owned by SAS.  If you have the Memex connector sources and an agreement
from Memex, note that the Memex connector requires compilation against a Memex
client library, usually called JavaMXIELIB.jar.  Copy that jar into this directory,
and the sources for the connector into the directory above, and the normal
connector ant build should build the connector.

The API for Memex Patriarch changes pretty dramatically between revisions.
The revision number this connector was written against was 1.3.0.
