This connector requires someone obtain correct versions of the appropriate wsdls
and xsds before it can be built.  This will require two utilities from Microsoft.  The
first is "disco.exe", which is a web-service discovery utility.  The second is a
Microsoft xml difference utility called xmldiffpatch.

disco.exe can be found under c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\V6.x\bin,
after Visual Studio is installed.  The xml diff utility used is downloadable from:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302294.aspx

Patches are meant to be applied using the xmlpatch.exe also included in the same package.

The Meridio version this comparision applies to is Meridio 5.0 SR 1.  With that version
of Meridio correctly installed, run the following disco commands, as modified with the
correct server name, credentials, and output directory:

disco /out:<output_directory> /username:<user_name> /password:<password> /domain:<domain> "http://<server_name>/DMWS/MeridioDMWS.asmx"
disco /out:<output_directory> /username:<user_name> /password:<password> /domain:<domain> "http://<server_name>/RMWS/MeridioRMWS.asmx"

Next, apply the patches:

xmlpatch MeridioDMWS.wsdl MeridioDMWS_axis.wsdl.xmldiff <outputdir>\MeridioDMWS_axis.wsdl
xmlpatch MeridioRMWS.wsdl MeridioRMWS_axis.wsdl.xmldiff <outputdir>\MeridioRMWS_axis.wsdl
xmlpatch DMDataSet.xsd DMDataSet.xsd.xmldiff <outputdir>\DMDataSet.xsd
xmlpatch RMDataSet.xsd RMDataSet.xsd.xmldiff <outputdir>\RMDataSet.xsd
xmlpatch RMClassificationDataSet.xsd RMClassificationDataSet.xsd.xmldiff <outputdir>\RMClassificationDataSet.xsd

The output files should then be ready for axis and castor, respectively.
