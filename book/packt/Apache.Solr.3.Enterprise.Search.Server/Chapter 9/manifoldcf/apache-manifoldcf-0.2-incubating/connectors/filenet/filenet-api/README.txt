Portions of the FileNet connector need to be compiled against a set of jars
delivered along with the FileNet API.  The version of the API seems to matter;
bugs are pretty rampant, and small point releases seem to be needed to correct them.

Copy the filenet API jars into this directory, and build the connector using the
provided ant build, and all processes should be built properly.  For some versions
of P8, there is a dependency on WASP, whose location you will need to specify
as an environment variable when you start the filenet connector server process.
See the "how-to-build-and-deploy.html" documentation page for details.

The version of the jars this connector was tested against code from Filenet
P8 API 4.0.0 (P8CE-4.0.0-002-Win), and later with P8 4.5.0.  The jars were re-labeled
with the prefix "ibm-" to avoid collision with the names of other jars, since many
of them were common with other packages such as xerces, but had been modified
in some way.
