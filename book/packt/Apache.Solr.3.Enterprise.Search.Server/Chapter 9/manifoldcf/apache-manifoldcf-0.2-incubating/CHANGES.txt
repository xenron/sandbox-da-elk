======================= Release 0.2 =======================
Release Date:  See http://incubator.apache.org/connectors for the official release date.

CONNECTORS-188: Change the eol-style attribute to LF for all the .sh files.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

Web site updated to reflect proposed release.

CONNECTORS-172: At the advice of the Derby team, build Derby in
"insane" mode to allow it to recover from internal errors.
(Koji Sekiguchi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-170: Add support to the Derby driver for periodic analysis and
reindexing, since after 10.7.1.1 it seems this is now supported.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-169: Add a method to the database abstraction to
return the maximum number of OR clauses in a query.  This is to make
Derby efficient, since it can't seem to use indexes in this situation
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-166: Pull a Derby fix down from trunk into Derby 10.7.1.1,
to fix deadlock problems
(Oleg Tikhonov, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-168: Change error reporting logic in Solr connector
to handle non-XML responses
(Fuad Efendi, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-159: Add support for external PostgreSQL server
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-165: Upgrade to jetty 6.1.26, plus patches, which is what
Solr is using.
(Robert Muir, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-163: Use Derby 10.7.1.1.
(Oleg Tikhonov, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-162: Add infrastructure support for derived resource
loading, so that individual connectors can use this model to prevent jar
conflicts.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-160: Add local trust store and working https support
for Solr connector.
(Carina Lannig, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-151: Add folder support to FileNet connector.
(Oleg Tikhonov, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-157: Web crawler url resolution was broken for relative
paths, because the way java.net.URI resolved them changed.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-156: Update site to describe work-around instructions.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-154: Add an ant target, and tests, that work against the
postgresql database.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-155: Fix a query bug with fetching the job status of a single,
specified job.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-148: Intermittent failures creating the PostgreSQL database
still occurring; traced the problem this time to PostgreSQL not accepting
a parameter for the password when creating a user.
(Nicolas Max, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-153: Add support for robots meta tag to web connector.
(Erlend Garåsen, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-152: Refactor notification thread and states to make the framework
more resilient.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-145: Refactor cleanup worker threads, expire threads, and
document delete threads to handle failure of the output connection gracefully.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-130: Block the Solr output connector from accepting documents
that have folder-level security.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-129: Add an API reset/outputconnections/xxx command, to 
forget the index state for an output connection.
(Karl Wright)

======================= Release 0.1 =======================
Release Date:  See http://incubator.apache.org/connectors for the official release date.

CONNECTORS-149: Expire threads did not obey rules as far as deleting documents
belonging to other jobs.  Also, the test for whether a document was shared between
jobs did not take the output connection into account.  Finally, I found an infinite
loop in the job delete stuffer thread code.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-147: Disable PDF's everywhere except for user documentation.
(Grant Ingersoll, David Crossley, Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-148: Creating the database in PostgreSQL failed intermittently
when a parameter was used for the encoding; the PostgreSQL documentation
specifies that it must be a quoted string in that case.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-146: Problem with document cleanup logic would cause data corruption
in carrydown data and in hopcount information.
(Karl Wright)

CONNECTORS-143: Copyright notice needs to be changed to 2011.

CONNECTORS-137: Add ASF headers to the jakarta standard tag library tld's
that the crawler-ui uses.  RAT detected these as a problem, and I have confirmed
that they have an Apache origin.

CONNECTORS-134: Put README.txt files in all empty directories that are meant
