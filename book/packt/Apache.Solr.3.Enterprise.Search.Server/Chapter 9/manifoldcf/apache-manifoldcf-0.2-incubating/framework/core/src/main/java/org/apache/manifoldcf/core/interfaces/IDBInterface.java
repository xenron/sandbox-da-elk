/** The purpose of this interface is to provide abstracted database table modification primitives,
* as well as general access primitives.  It is expected that the generalized database layer will
* provide the underlying services.  This layer should provide services roughly equivalent to
* the former DBInterface bean, but be callable in a pure Java fashion.
* It is furthermore intended that all abstraction database requests go through this layer.  It
* will therefore, over time, provide grander and grander levels of database query abstraction.
*
* Also note that the database parameters will be passed to the factory for this class, not
* to the individual methods.
