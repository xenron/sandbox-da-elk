/** This interface abstracts from the activities that use and govern events.
*
* The purpose of this model is to allow a connector to:
* (a) insure that documents whose prerequisites have not been met do not get processed until those prerequisites are completed
* (b) guarantee that only one thread at a time deal with sequencing of documents
*
* The way it works is as follows.  We define the notion of an "event", which is described by a simple string (and thus can be global,
* local to a connection, or local to a job, whichever is appropriate).  An event is managed solely by the connector that knows about it.
* Effectively it can be in either of two states: "completed", or "pending".  The only time the framework ever changes an event state is when
* the crawler is restarted, at which point all pending events are marked "completed".
*
* Documents, when they are added to the processing queue, specify the set of events on which they will block.  If an event is in the "pending" state,
* no documents that block on that event will be processed at that time.  Of course, it is possible that a document could be handed to processing just before
* an event entered the "pending" state - in which case it is the responsibility of the connector itself to avoid any problems or conflicts.  This can
* usually be handled by proper handling of event signalling.  More on that later.
*
* The presumed underlying model of flow inside the connector's processing method is as follows:
* (1) The connector examines the document in question, and decides whether it can be processed successfully or not, based on what it knows about sequencing
* (2) If the connector determines that the document can properly be processed, it does so, and that's it.
* (3) If the connector finds a sequencing-related problem, it:
*     (a) Begins an appropriate event sequence.
*     (b) If the framework indicates that this event is already in the "pending" state, then some other thread is already handling the event, and the connector
*          should abort processing of the current document.
*     (c) If the framework successfully begins the event sequence, then the connector code knows unequivocably that it is the only thread processing the event.
*         It should take whatever action it needs to - which might be requesting special documents, for instance.  [Note well: At this time, there is no way
*         to guarantee that special documents added to the queue are in fact properly synchronized by this mechanism, so I recommend avoiding this practice,
*         and instead handling any special document sequences without involving the queue.]
*     (d) If the connector CANNOT successfully take the action it needs to to push the sequence along, it MUST set the event back to the "completed" state.
*         Otherwise, the event will remain in the "pending" state until the next time the crawler is restarted.
*     (e) If the current document cannot yet be processed, its processing should be aborted.
* (4) When the connector determines that the event's conditions have been met, or when it determines that an event sequence is no longer viable and has been
*     aborted, it must set the event status to "completed".
*
* In summary, a connector may perform the following event-related actions:
* (a) Set an event into the "pending" state
* (b) Set an event into the "completed" state
* (c) Add a document to the queue with a specified set of prerequisite events attached
* (d) Request that the current document be requeued for later processing (i.e. abort processing of a document due to sequencing reasons)
