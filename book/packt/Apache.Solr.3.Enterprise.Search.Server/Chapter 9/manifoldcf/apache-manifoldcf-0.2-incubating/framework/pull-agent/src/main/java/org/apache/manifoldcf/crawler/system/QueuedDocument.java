/** This class represents a document that will be placed on the document queue, and will be
* processed by a worker thread.
* The reason that DocumentDescription by itself is not used has to do with the fact that
* a good deal more information about the document must be obtained in order to find the
* last version ingested (which must be done in bulk, for performance reasons).  Since we
* are finding everything anyway, it makes sense to put what we have in a structure so
* that the worker threads don't need to repeat what the stuffer thread did.
