/** An instance of this class keeps track of a pool of documents that the stuffer thread believes are ready to be reprioritized.
* The way it works is that when the stuffer sees documents that it can't use, but which it thinks are eligible from reprioritization,
* it hands them to this object.  The prioritization thread then takes documents out of this queue and prioritizes them, before it
* goes looking for other documents.  This process guarantees that the stuffer is not blocked by documents that need reprioritization.
