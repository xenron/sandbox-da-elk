/** This class attempts to provide document priorities in order to acheive as much balance as possible between documents having different bins.
* A document's priority assignment takes place at the time the document is added to the queue, and will be recalculated when a job is aborted, or
* when the crawler daemon is started.  The document priorities are strictly obeyed when documents are chosen from the queue and handed to
* worker threads; higher-priority documents always have precedence, except due to deliberate priority adjustment specified by the job priority.
*
* The priority values themselves are logarithmic: 0.0 is the highest, and the larger the number, the lower the priority.
*
* The basis for the calculation for each document priority handed out by this module are:
*
* - number of documents having a given bin (tracked)
* - performance of a connection (gathered through statistics)
* - throttling that applies to the each document bin
*
*
* The queuing prioritization model hooks into the document lifecycle in the following places:
* (1) When a document is added to the queue (and thus when its priority is handed out)
* (2) When documents that were *supposed* to be added to the queue turned out to already be there and already have an established priority,
*     (in which case the priority that was handed out before is returned to the pool for reuse)
* (3) When a document is pulled from the database queue (which sets the current highest priority level that should not be exceeded in step (1))
*
* The assignment prioritization model is largely independent of the queuing prioritization model, and is used to select among documents that have
* been marked "active" as they are handed to worker threads.  These events cause information to be logged:
* (1) When a document is handed to a worker thread
* (2) When the worker thread completes the document
