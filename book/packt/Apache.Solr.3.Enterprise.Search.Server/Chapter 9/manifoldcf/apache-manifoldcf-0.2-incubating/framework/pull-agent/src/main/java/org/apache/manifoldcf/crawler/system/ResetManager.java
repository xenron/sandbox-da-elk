/** The reset manager basically keeps track of threads that work together.  If the
* threads get hosed as a result of problems, then certain resets need to be done.
* Each instance of this manager therefore tracks all the threads which depend or
* affect a condition that needs explicit resetting.  When a thread recognizes that
* the database (or whatever resource) is potentially in a state where a reset for
* the particular condition is required, then the corresponding reset manager object
* will cause all dependent threads to block, until they are all accounted for.
* Then, the corrective reset is done, and the threads are released (with a signal
* corresponding to the fact that a reset occurred returned).
*
* This class is meant to be extended in order to implement the exact reset
* functionality required.
