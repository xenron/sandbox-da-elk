/** This interface describes an instance of a connection between an engine that needs to output documents,
* and an output connector.
*
* Each instance of this interface is used in only one thread at a time.  Connection Pooling
* on these kinds of objects is performed by the factory which instantiates connector objects
* from symbolic names and config parameters, and is pooled by these parameters.  That is, a pooled connector
* handle is used only if all the connection parameters for the handle match.
*
* Implementers of this interface should provide a default constructor which has this signature:
*
* xxx();
*
* Connector instances are either configured or not.  If configured, they will persist in a pool, and be
* reused multiple times.  Certain methods of a connector may be called before the connector is
* configured.  This includes basically all methods that permit inspection of the connector's
* capabilities.  The complete list is:
*
*
* The purpose of the output connector is to allow documents to be sent to their final destination (as far as
* Connector Framework is concerned).
