  /** Record time-stamped information about the activity of the output connector.
  *@param startTime is either null or the time since the start of epoch in milliseconds (Jan 1, 1970).  Every
  *       activity has an associated time; the startTime field records when the activity began.  A null value
  *       indicates that the start time and the finishing time are the same.
  *@param activityType is a string which is fully interpretable only in the context of the connector involved, which is
  *       used to categorize what kind of activity is being recorded.  For example, a web connector might record a
  *       "fetch document" activity.  Cannot be null.
  *@param dataSize is the number of bytes of data involved in the activity, or null if not applicable.
  *@param entityURI is a (possibly long) string which identifies the object involved in the history record.
  *       The interpretation of this field will differ from connector to connector.  May be null.
  *@param resultCode contains a terse description of the result of the activity.  The description is limited in
  *       size to 255 characters, and can be interpreted only in the context of the current connector.  May be null.
  *@param resultDescription is a (possibly long) human-readable string which adds detail, if required, to the result
  *       described in the resultCode field.  This field is not meant to be queried on.  May be null.
