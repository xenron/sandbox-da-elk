<h2 class="h3">Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>This manual is intended for an end-user of ManifoldCF.  It is assumed that the Framework has been properly installed, either by you or by a system integrator,
                   with all required services running and desired connection types properly registered.  If you think you need to know how to do that yourself, please visit the "Developer Resources" page.
            </p>
<p>Most of this manual describes how to use the ManifoldCF user interface.  On a standard ManifoldCF deployment, you would reach that interface by giving your browser
                  a URL something like this: <span class="codefrag">http://my-server-name:8080/acf-crawler-ui</span>.  This will, of course, differ from system to system.  Please contact your system administrator
                  to find out what URL is appropriate for your environment.
            </p>
<p>The ManifoldCF UI has been tested with Firefox and various incarnations of Internet Explorer.  If you use another browser, there is a small chance that the UI
                  will not work properly.  Please let your system integrator know if you find any browser incompatibility problems.</p>
<p>When you do manage to enter the Framework user interface the first time, you should see a screen that looks something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Welcome Screen" src="images/welcome-screen.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On the left, there are menu options you can select.  The main pane on the right shows a welcome message, but depending on what you select on the left, the contents of the main pane
                  will change.  Before you try to accomplish anything, please take a moment to read the descriptions below of the menu selections, and thus get an idea of how the Framework works
                  as a whole.
            </p>
<a name="N10031"></a><a name="outputs"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Defining Output Connections</h3>
<p>The Framework UI's left-side menu contains a link for listing output connections.  An output connection is a connection to a system or place where documents fetched from various
                       repositories can be written to.  This is often a search engine.</p>
<p>All jobs must specify an output connection.  You can create an output connection by clicking the "List Output Connections" link in the left-side navigation menu.  When you do this, the
                       following screen will appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="List Output Connections" src="images/list-output-connections.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On a freshly created system, there may well be no existing output connections listed.  If there are already output connections, they will be listed on this screen, along with links that allow
                      you to view, edit, or delete them.  To create a new output connection, click the "Add new output connection" link at the bottom.  The following screen will then appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Output Connection, specify Name" src="images/add-new-output-connection-name.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The tabs across the top each present a different view of your output connection.  Each tab allows you to edit a different characteristic of that connection.  The exact set of tabs you see
                       depends on the connection type you choose for the connection.</p>
<p>Start by giving your connection a name and a description.  Remember that all output connection names must be unique, and cannot be changed after the connection is defined.  The name must be
                       no more than 32 characters long.  The description can be up to 255 characters long.  When you are done, click on the "Type" tab.  The Type tab for the connection will then appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Output Connection, select Type" src="images/add-new-output-connection-type.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The list of output connection types in the pulldown box, and what they are each called, is determined by your system integrator.  The configuration tabs for each different kind of output connection
                       type are described in separate sections below.</p>
<p>After you choose an output connection type, click the "Continue" button at the bottom of the pane.  You will then see all the tabs appropriate for that kind of connection appear, and a
                       "Save" button will also appear at the bottom of the pane.  You <b>must</b> click the "Save" button when you are done in order to create your connection.  If you click "Cancel" instead, the new connection
                       will not be created.  (The same thing will happen if you click on any of the navigation links in the left-hand pane.)</p>
<p>Every output connection has a "Throttling" tab.  The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Output Connection Throttling" src="images/output-throttling.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On this tab, you can specify only one thing: how many open connections are allowed at any given time to the system the output connection talks with.  This restriction helps prevent
                       that system from being overloaded, or in some cases exceeding its license limitations.  Conversely, making this number larger allows for greater overall throughput.  The default
                       value is 10, which may not be optimal for all types of output connections.  Please refer to the section of the manual describing your output connection type for more precise
                       recommendations.
                </p>
<p>Please refer to the section of the manual describing your chosen output connection type for a description of the tabs appropriate for that connection type.</p>
<p>After you save your connection, a summary screen will be displayed that describes your connection's configuration.  This summary screen contains a line where the connection's status
                       is displayed.  If you did everything correctly, the message "Connection working" will be displayed as a status.  If there was a problem, you will see a connection-type-specific diagnostic message instead.
                       If this happens, you will need to correct the problem, by either fixing your infrastructure, or by editing the connection configuration appropriately, before the output connection
                       will work correctly.</p>
<a name="N10088"></a><a name="authorities"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Defining Authority Connections</h3>
<p>The Framework UI's left-side menu contains a link for listing authority connections.  An authority connection is a connection to a system that defines a particular security environment.
                       For example, if you want to index some documents that are protected by Active Directory, you would need to configure an Active Directory authority connection.</p>
<p>You may not need an authority if you do not mind that portions of all the documents you want to index are visible to everyone.  For web crawling and RSS crawling, this might be the
                       situation.  Most other repositories have some security mechanism, however.</p>
<p>You should define your authority connections <b>before</b> setting up your repository connections.  While it is possible to change the relationship between a repository connection
                       and its authority after-the-fact, in practice such changes may cause many documents to require reindexing.</p>
<p>You can create an authority connection by clicking the "List Authority Connections" link in the left-side navigation menu.  When you do this, the
                       following screen will appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="List Authority Connections" src="images/list-authority-connections.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On a freshly created system, there may well be no existing authority connections listed.  If there are already authority connections, they will be listed on this screen, along with links
                       that allow you to view, edit, or delete them.  To create a new authority connection, click the "Add a new connection" link at the bottom.  The following screen will then appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Authority Connection, specify Name" src="images/add-new-authority-connection-name.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The tabs across the top each present a different view of your authority connection.  Each tab allows you to edit a different characteristic of that connection.  The exact set of tabs you see
                       depends on the connection type you choose for the connection.</p>
<p>Start by giving your connection a name and a description.  Remember that all authority connection names must be unique, and cannot be changed after the connection is defined.  The name must be
                       no more than 32 characters long.  The description can be up to 255 characters long.  When you are done, click on the "Type" tab.  The Type tab for the connection will then appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Authority Connection, select Type" src="images/add-new-authority-connection-type.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The list of authority connection types in the pulldown box, and what they are each called, is determined by your system integrator.  The configuration tabs for each different kind of authority connection
                       type are described in separate sections below.</p>
<p>After you choose an authority connection type, click the "Continue" button at the bottom of the pane.  You will then see all the tabs appropriate for that kind of connection appear, and a
                       "Save" button will also appear at the bottom of the pane.  You <b>must</b> click the "Save" button when you are done in order to create your connection.  If you click "Cancel" instead, the new connection
                       will not be created.  (The same thing will happen if you click on any of the navigation links in the left-hand pane.)</p>
<p>Every authority connection has a "Throttling" tab.  The tab looks like this:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>On this tab, you can specify only one thing: how many open connections are allowed at any given time to the system the authority connection talks with.  This restriction helps prevent
                       that system from being overloaded, or in some cases exceeding its license limitations.  Conversely, making this number larger allows for smaller average search latency.  The default
                       value is 10, which may not be optimal for all types of authority connections.  Please refer to the section of the manual describing your authority connection type for more precise
                       recommendations.
                </p>
<p>Please refer to the section of the manual describing your chosen authority connection type for a description of the tabs appropriate for that connection type.</p>
<p>After you save your connection, a summary screen will be displayed that describes your connection's configuration.  This summary screen contains a line where the connection's status
                       is displayed.  If you did everything correctly, the message "Connection working" will be displayed as a status.  If there was a problem, you will see a connection-type-specific diagnostic message instead.

<h3 class="h4">Defining Repository Connections</h3>
<p>The Framework UI's left-hand menu contains a link for listing repository connections.  A repository connection is a connection to the repository system that contains the documents
                       that you are interested in indexing.</p>
<p>All jobs require you to specify a repository connection, because that is where they get their documents from.  It is therefore necessary to create a repository connection before
                       indexing any documents.</p>
<p>A repository connection also may have an associated authority connection.  This specified authority determines the security environment in which documents from the repository
                       connection are placed.  While it is possible to change the specified authority for a repository connection after a crawl has been done, in practice this will require that all documents
                       associated with that repository connection be reindexed.  Therefore, we recommend that you set up your desired authority connection before defining your repository connection.</p>
<p>You can create a repository connection by clicking the "List Repository Connections" link in the left-side navigation menu.  When you do this, the
                       following screen will appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">

                       that allow you to view, edit, or delete them.  To create a new repository connection, click the "Add a new connection" link at the bottom.  The following screen will then appear:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>The tabs across the top each present a different view of your repository connection.  Each tab allows you to edit a different characteristic of that connection.  The exact set of tabs you see
                       depends on the connection type you choose for the connection.</p>
<p>Start by giving your connection a name and a description.  Remember that all repository connection names must be unique, and cannot be changed after the connection is defined.  The name must be
                       no more than 32 characters long.  The description can be up to 255 characters long.  When you are done, click on the "Type" tab.  The Type tab for the connection will then appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Repository Connection, select Type" src="images/add-new-repository-connection-type.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The list of repository connection types in the pulldown box, and what they are each called, is determined by your system integrator.  The configuration tabs for each different kind of repository connection
                       type are described in separate sections below.</p>
<p>You may also at this point select the authority connection to secure all documents fetched from this repository with.  Bear in mind that only some authority connection types are compatible with any
                       given repository connection types.  Read the details of your desired repository or authority connection type to understand its intentions, and how it is expected to be used.</p>
<p>After you choose the desired repository connection type and an authority connection, click the "Continue" button at the bottom of the pane.  You will then see all the tabs appropriate for that kind of connection appear, and a
                       "Save" button will also appear at the bottom of the pane.  You <b>must</b> click the "Save" button when you are done in order to create or update your connection.  If you click "Cancel" instead, the new connection
                       will not be created.  (The same thing will happen if you click on any of the navigation links in the left-hand pane.)</p>
<p>Every repository connection has a "Throttling" tab.  The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Repository Connection Throttling" src="images/repository-throttling.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On this tab, you can specify two things.  The first is how many open connections are allowed at any given time to the system the authority connection talks with.  This restriction helps prevent
                       that system from being overloaded, or in some cases exceeding its license limitations.  Conversely, making this number larger allows for smaller average search latency.  The default
                       value is 10, which may not be optimal for all types of repository connections.  Please refer to the section of the manual describing your authority connection type for more precise
                       recommendations.  The second specifies how rapidly, on average, the crawler will fetch documents via this connection.
                </p>
<p>Each connection type has its own notion of "throttling bin".  A throttling bin is the name of a resource whose access needs to be throttled.  For example, the Web connection type uses a
                       document's server name as the throttling bin associated with the document, since (presumably) it will be access to each individual server that will need to be throttled independently.
                </p>
<p>On the repository connection "Throttling" tab, you can specify an unrestricted number of throttling descriptions.  Each throttling description consists of a regular expression that describes
                       a family of throttling bins, plus a helpful description, plus an average number of fetches per minute for each of the throttling bins that matches the regular expression.  If a given
                       throttling bin matches more than one throttling description, the most conservative fetch rate is chosen.</p>
<p>The simplest regular expression you can use is the empty regular expression.  This will match all of the connection's throttle bins, and thus will allow you to specify a default
                       throttling policy for the connection.  Set the desired average fetch rate, and click the "Add" button.  The throttling tab will then appear something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Repository Connection Throttling With Throttle" src="images/repository-throttling-with-throttle.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>If no throttle descriptions are added, no fetch-rate throttling will be performed.</p>
<p>Please refer to the section of the manual describing your chosen repository connection type for a description of the tabs appropriate for that connection type.</p>
<p>After you save your connection, a summary screen will be displayed that describes your connection's configuration.  This summary screen contains a line where the connection's status
                       is displayed.  If you did everything correctly, the message "Connection working" will be displayed as a status.  If there was a problem, you will see a connection-type-specific diagnostic message instead.
                       If this happens, you will need to correct the problem, by either fixing your infrastructure, or by editing the connection configuration appropriately, before the authority connection
                       will work correctly.</p>
<a name="N1015F"></a><a name="jobs"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Creating Jobs</h3>
<p>A "job" in ManifoldCF is a description of a set of documents.  The Framework's job is to fetch this set of documents come from a specific repository connection, and
                       send them to a specific output connection.  The repository connection that is associated with the job will determine exactly how this set of documents is described, and to some
                       degree how they are indexed.  The output connection associated with the job can also affect how each document is indexed.</p>
<p>Every job is expected to be run more than once.  Each time a job is run, it is responsible not only for sending new or changed documents to the output connection, but also for
                       notifying the output connection of any documents that are no longer part of the set.  Note that there are two ways for a document to no longer be part of the included set of documents:
                       Either the document may have been deleted from the repository, or the document may no longer be included in the allowed set of documents.  The Framework handles each case properly.</p>
<p>Deleting a job causes the output connection to be notified of deletion for all documents belonging to that job.  This makes sense because the job represents the set of documents, which would
                       otherwise be orphaned when the job was removed.  (Some users make the assumption that a ManifoldCF job represents nothing more than a task, which is an incorrect
                       assumption.)</p>
<p>Note that the Framework allows jobs that describe overlapping sets of documents to be defined.  Documents that exist in more than one job are treated in the following special ways:</p>
<ul>
                    
<li>When a job is deleted, the output connection is notified of deletion of documents belonging to that job only if they don't belong to another job</li>
                    
<li>The version of the document sent to the output connection depends on which job was run last</li>
                
</ul>
<p>The subtle logic of overlapping documents means that you probably want to avoid this situation entirely, if it is at all feasible.</p>
<p>A typical non-continuous run of a job has the following stages of execution:</p>
<ol>
                    
<li>Adding the job's new, changed, or deleted starting points to the queue ("seeding")</li>
                    
<li>Fetching documents, discovering new documents, and detecting deletions</li>
                    
<li>Removing no-longer-included documents from the queue</li>
                
</ol>
<p>Jobs can also be run "continuously", which means that the job never completes, unless it is aborted.  A continuous run has different stages of execution:</p>
<ol>
                    
<li>Adding the job's new, changed, or deleted starting points to the queue ("seeding")</li>
                    
<li>Fetching documents, discovering new documents, and detecting deletions, while reseeding periodically</li>
                
</ol>
<p>Note that continuous jobs <b>cannot</b> remove no-longer-included documents from the queue.  They can only remove documents that have been deleted from the repository.</p>
<p>A job can independently be configured to start when explicitly started by a user, or to run on a user-specified schedule.  If a job is set up to run on a schedule, it can be made to
                      start only at the beginning of a schedule window, or to start again within any remaining schedule window when the previous job run completes.</p>
<p>There is no restriction in ManifoldCF as to how many jobs many running at any given time.</p>
<p>You create a job by first clicking on the "List All Jobs" link on the left-side menu.  The following screen will appear:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="List Jobs" src="images/list-jobs.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You may view, edit, or delete any existing jobs by clicking on the appropriate link.  You may also create a new job that is a copy of an existing job.  But to create a brand-new job,
                       click the "Add a new job" link at the bottom.  You will then see the following page:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Job, name tab" src="images/add-new-job-name.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Give your job a name.  Note that job names do <b>not</b> have to be unique, although it is probably less confusing to have a different name for each one.  Then, click the
                       "Connection" tab:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Job, connection tab" src="images/add-new-job-connection.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now, you should select both the output connection name, and the repository connection name.  Bear in mind that whatever you select cannot be changed after the job is saved
                       the first time.</p>
<p>You also have the opportunity to modify the job's priority and start method at this time.  The priority
                       controls how important this job's documents are, relative to documents from any other job.  The higher the number, the more important it is considered for that job's documents to be
                       fetched first.  The start method is as previously described; you get a choice of manual start, starting on the beginning of a scheduling window, or starting whenever possible within
                       a scheduling window.</p>
<p>Make your selections, and click "Continue".  The rest of the job's tabs will now appear, and a
                       "Save" button will also appear at the bottom of the pane.  You <b>must</b> click the "Save" button when you are done in order to create or update your job.  If you click "Cancel" instead, the new job
                       will not be created.  (The same thing will happen if you click on any of the navigation links in the left-hand pane.)</p>
<p>All jobs have a "Scheduling" tab.  The scheduling tab allows you to set up schedule-related configuration information:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Job, scheduling tab" src="images/add-new-job-scheduling.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On this tab, you can specify the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
                    
<li>Whether the job runs continuously, or scans every document once</li>
                    
<li>How long a document should remain alive before it is 'expired', and removed from the index</li>
                    
<li>How long an interval before a document is re-checked, to see if it has changed</li>
                    
<li>How long to wait before reseeding initial documents</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>The last three parameters only make sense if a job is a continuously running one, as the UI indicates.</p>
<p>The other thing you can do on this time is to define an appropriate set of scheduling records.  Each scheduling record defines some related set of intervals during which the job can run.  The
                       intervals are determined by the starting time (which is defined by the day of week, month, day, hour, and minute pulldowns), and the maximum run time in minutes, which determines
                       when the interval ends.  It is, of course, possible to select multiple values for each of the pulldowns, in which case you be describing a starting time that had to match at least <b>one</b>
                       of the selected values for <b>each</b> of the specified fields.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the schedule values you want, click the "Add Scheduled Time" button:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Add New Job, scheduling tab with record" src="images/add-new-job-scheduling-with-record.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The example shows a schedule where crawls are run on Saturday and Sunday nights at 2 AM, and run for no more than 4 hours.</p>
<p>The rest of the job tabs depend on the types of the connections you selected.  Please refer to the section of the manual
                       describing the appropriate connection types corresponding to your chosen repository and output connections for a description of the job tabs that will appear for those connections.</p>
<a name="N10220"></a><a name="executing"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Executing Jobs</h3>
<p>You can follow what is going on, and control the execution of your jobs, by clicking on the "Status and Job Management" link on the left-side navigation menu.  When you do, you might
                       see something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Job Status" src="images/job-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>From here, you can click the "Refresh" link at the bottom of the main pane to see an updated status display, or you can directly control the job using the links in the leftmost
                       status column.  Allowed actions you may see at one point or another include:</p>
<ul>
                    
<li>Start (start the job)</li>
                    
<li>Abort(abort the job)</li>
                    
<li>Pause (pause the job)</li>
                    
<li>Resume (resume the job)</li>
                    
<li>Restart (equivalent to aborting the job, and starting it all over again)</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>The columns "Documents", "Active", and "Processed" have very specific means as far as documents in the job's queue are concerned.  The "Documents" column counts all the documents
                       that belong to the job.  The "Active" column counts all of the documents for that job that are queued up for processing.  The "Processed" column counts all documents that are on the
                       queue for the job that have been processed at least once in the past.</p>
<a name="N1024F"></a><a name="statusreports"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Status Reports</h3>
<p>Every job in ManifoldCF describes a set of documents.  A reference to each document in the set is kept in a job-specific queue.  It is sometimes valuable for
                       diagnostic reasons to examine this queue for information.  The Framework UI has several canned reports which do just that.</p>
<p>Each status report allows you to select what documents you are interested in from a job's queue based on the following information:</p>
<ul>
                    
<li>The job</li>
                    
<li>The document identifier</li>
                    
<li>The document's status and state</li>
                    
<li>When the document is scheduled to be processed next</li>
                
</ul>
<a name="N1026A"></a><a name="documentstatus"></a>
<h4>Document Status</h4>
<p>A document status report simply lists all matching documents from within the queue, along with their state, status, and planned future activity.  You might use this report if you were
                           trying to figure out (for example) whether a specific document had been processed yet during a job run.</p>
<p>Click on the "Document Status" link on the left-hand menu.  You will see a screen that looks something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Document Status, select connection" src="images/document-status-select-connection.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the desired connection.  You may also select the desired document state and status, as well as specify a regular expression for the document identifier, if you want.  Then,
                           click the "Continue" button:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Document Status, select job" src="images/document-status-select-job.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the job whose documents you want to see, and click "Continue" once again.  The results will display:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Document Status, example" src="images/document-status-example.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You may alter the criteria, and click "Go" again, if you so choose.  Or, you can alter the number of result rows displayed at a time, and click "Go" to redisplay.  Finally, you can page
                           up and down through the results using the "Prev" and "Next" links.</p>
<a name="N102A1"></a><a name="queuestatus"></a>
<h4>Queue Status</h4>
<p>A queue status report is an aggregate report that counts the number of occurrences of documents in specified classes.  The classes are specified as a grouping within a regular
                           expression, which is matched against all specified document identifiers.  The results that are displayed are counts of documents.  There will be a column for each combination of
                           document state and status.</p>
<p>For example, a class specification of "()" will produce exactly one result row, and will provide a count of documents that are in each state/status combination.  A class description
                           of "(.*)", on the other hand, will create one row for each document identifier, and will put a "1" in the column representing state and status of that document, with a "0" in all other
                           column positions.</p>
<p>Click the "Queue Status" link on the left-hand menu.  You will see a screen that looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Queue Status, select connection" src="images/queue-status-select-connection.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the desired connection.  You may also select the desired document state and status, as well as specify a regular expression for the document identifier, if you want.  You
                           will probably want to change the document identifier class from its default value of "(.*)".  Then, click the "Continue" button:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Queue Status, select job" src="images/queue-status-select-job.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the job whose documents you want to see, and click "Continue" once again.  The results will display:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Queue Status, example" src="images/queue-status-example.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You may alter the criteria, and click "Go" again, if you so choose.  Or, you can alter the number of result rows displayed at a time, and click "Go" to redisplay.  Finally, you can page
                           up and down through the results using the "Prev" and "Next" links.</p>
<a name="N102DC"></a><a name="historyreports"></a>
<h3 class="h4">History Reports</h3>
<p>For every repository connection, ManifoldCF keeps a history of what has taken place involving that connection.  This history includes both events that the
                       framework itself logs, as well as events that a repository connection or output connection will log.  These individual events are categorized by "activity type".  Some of the kinds of
                       activity types that exist are:</p>
<ul>
                    
<li>Job start</li>
                    
<li>Job end</li>
                    
<li>Job abort</li>
                    
<li>Various connection-type-specific read or access operations</li>
                    
<li>Various connection-type-specific output or indexing operations</li>
                
</ul>
<p>This history can be enormously helpful in understand how your system is behaving, and whether or not it is working properly.  For this reason, the Framework UI has the ability to
                       generate several canned reports which query this history data and display the results.</p>
<p>All history reports allow you to specify what history records you are interested in including.  These records are selected using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
                    
<li>The repository connection name</li>
                    
<li>The activity type(s) desired</li>
                    
<li>The start time desired</li>
                    
<li>The end time desired</li>
                    
<li>The identifier(s) involved, specified as a regular expression</li>
                    
<li>The result(s) produced, specified as a regular expression</li>
                
</ul>
<p>The actual reports available are designed to be useful for diagnosing both access issues, and performance issues.  See below for a summary of the types available.</p>
<a name="N10315"></a><a name="simplehistory"></a>
<h4>Simple History Reports</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, a simple history report does not attempt to aggregate any data, but instead just lists matching records from the repository connection's history.
                           These records are initially presented in most-recent-first order, and include columns for the start and end time of the event, the kind of activity represented by the event,
                           the identifier involved, the number of bytes involved, and the results of the event.  Once displayed, you may choose to display more or less data, or reorder the display by column, or page through the data.</p>
<p>To get started, click on the "Simple History" link on the left-hand menu.  You will see a screen that looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Simple History Report, select connection" src="images/simple-history-select-connection.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now, select the desired repository connection from the pulldown in the upper left hand corner.  If you like, you can also change the specified date/time range, or specify an identifier
                           regular expression or result code regular expression.  By default, the date/time range selects all events within the last hour, while the identifier regular expression and result code
                           regular expression matches all identifiers and result codes.</p>
<p>Next, click the "Continue" button.  A list of pertinent activities should then appear in a pulldown in the upper right:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Simple History Report, select activities" src="images/simple-history-select-activities.PNG" width="80%"></div>

<h3 class="h4">A Note About Credentials</h3>
<p>If any of your selected connection types require credentials, you may find it necessary to approach your system administrator to obtain an appropriate set.  System administrators
                       are often reluctant to provide accounts and credentials that have any more power than is utterly necessary, and sometimes not even that.  Great care has been taken in the
                       development of all connection types to be sure they require no more privilege than is utterly necessary.  If a security-related warning appears when you view a connection's
                       status, you must inform the system administrator that the credentials are inadequate to allow the connection to accomplish its task, and work with him/her to correct the problem.

<h2 class="h3">Output Connection Types</h2>
<div class="section">
<a name="N10382"></a><a name="solroutputconnector"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Solr Output Connection</h3>
<p>The Solr output connection type is designed to allow ManifoldCF to submit documents to an appropriate Solr pipeline, via the Solr
                       HTTP ingestion API.  The configuration parameters are set to the default Solr values, which can be changed (since Solr's configuration can be changed).
                       The Solr output connection type furthermore makes no judgment as to whether a given document is indexable or not - it accepts everything, and passes all documents
                       on to the pipeline, where presumably the configured pipeline will decide if a document should be rejected or not.  (All of that happens without a Solr connection
                       being aware of it in any way.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this lack of specificity comes at a cost.  Unless you take care to filter documents properly in each job, large movie files or other opaque
                       content may well be picked up and sent to Solr for indexing, which will greatly increase the dead load on the overall system.  It is therefore a good idea to review
                       all crawls done through a Solr connection while they are underway, to be sure there isn't a misconfiguration of this kind.</p>
<p>When you create a Solr output connection, three configuration tabs appear.  The "Server" tab allows you to configure the HTTP target of the connection:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Solr Configuration, Server tab" src="images/solr-configure-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Fill in the fields according to your Solr configuration.  The Solr connection type supports only basic authentication at this time; if you have this enabled, supply the credentials
                       as requested on the bottom part of the form.</p>
<p>The second tab is the "Schema" tab, which allows you to specify the name of the Solr field to use as a document identifier.  The Solr connection type will treat
                       this field as being a unique key for locating the indexed document for further modification or deletion:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Solr Configuration, Schema tab" src="images/solr-configure-schema.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The third tab is the "Arguments" tab, which allows you to specify arbitrary arguments to be sent to Solr.  This is a popular way of telling Solr how to handle
                       specific documents, so the connection type allows you to add arguments to each Solr indexing request:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Solr Configuration, Arguments tab" src="images/solr-configure-arguments.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Fill in the argument name and value, and click the "Add" button.  Bear in mind that if you add an argument with the same name as an existing one, it will replace the
                       existing one with the new specified value.  You can delete existing arguments by clicking the "Delete" button next to the argument you want to delete.</p>
<p>When you are done, don't forget to click the "Save" button to save your changes!  When you do, a connection summary and status screen will be presented, which
                       may look something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Solr Status" src="images/solr-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note that in this example, the Solr connection is not responding, which is leading to an error status message instead of "Connection working".</p>
<p>When you configure a job to use a Solr-type output connection, the Solr connection type provides a tab called "Field Mapping".  The purpose of this tab
                       is to allow you to map metadata fields as fetched by the job's connection type to fields that Solr is set up to receive.  This is necessary because
                       the names of the metadata items are often determined by the repository, with no alignment to fields defined in the Solr schema.  You may also
                       suppress specific metadata items from being sent to the index using this tab.  The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Solr Specification, Field Mapping tab" src="images/solr-job-field-mapping.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Add a new mapping by filling in the "source" with the name of the metadata item from the repository, and "target" as the name of the output field in
                       Solr, and click the "Add" button.  Leaving the "target" field blank will result in all metadata items of that name not being sent to Solr.</p>
<a name="N103E1"></a><a name="gtsoutputconnector"></a>
<h3 class="h4">MetaCarta GTS Output Connection</h3>
<p>The MetaCarta GTS output connection type is designed to allow ManifoldCF to submit documents to an appropriate MetaCarta GTS search
                       appliance, via the appliance's HTTP Ingestion API.</p>
<p>The connection type implicitly understands that GTS can only handle text, HTML, XML, RTF, PDF, and Microsoft Office documents.  All other document types will be
                       considered to be unindexable.  This helps prevent jobs based on a GTS-type output connection from fetching data that is large, but of no particular relevance.</p>
<p>When you configure a job to use a GTS-type output connection, two additional tabs will be presented to the user: "Collections" and "Document Templates".  These
                       tabs allow per-job specification of these GTS-specific features.</p>
<p>More here later</p>
<a name="N103F4"></a><a name="nulloutputconnector"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Null Output Connection</h3>
<p>The null output connection type is meant primarily to function as an aid for people writing repository connection types.  It is not expected to be useful in practice.</p>
<p>The null output connection type simply logs indexing and deletion requests, and does nothing else.  It does not have any special configuration tabs, nor does it
                       contribute tabs to jobs defined that use it.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="N10408"></a><a name="adauthority"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Active Directory Authority Connection</h3>
<p>An active directory authority connection is essential for enforcing security for documents from Windows shares, Microsoft SharePoint, and IBM FileNet repositories.
                       This connection type needs to be provided with information about how to log into an appropriate Windows domain controller, with a user that has sufficient privileges to
                       be able to look up any user's ID and group relationships.  While the connection type has some known limitations, it should function well for most straightforward Windows
                       security architecture situations.  The cases in which it may not be adequate include:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>when child domains are present</li>
                    
<li>when the expected number of requests per second is fairly high</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>An active directory authority connection type has a single special tab in the authority connection editing screen: the "Domain Controller" tab:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="AD Configuration, Domain Controller tab" src="images/ad-configure-dc.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Fill in the requested values.  Note that the "Administrative user name" field usually requires no domain suffix, but depending on the details of how the domain
                       controller is configured, may sometimes only accept the "name@domain" format.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button.  When you do, a connection
                       summary and status screen will be presented, which
                       may look something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="AD Status" src="images/ad-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note that in this example, the Active Directory connection is not responding, which is leading to an error status message instead of "Connection working".</p>
<a name="N10441"></a><a name="livelinkauthority"></a>
<h3 class="h4">OpenText LiveLink Authority Connection</h3>
<p>A LiveLink authority connection is needed to enforce security for documents retrieved from LiveLink repositories.</p>
<p>In order to function, this connection type needs to be provided with 
                    information about the name of the LiveLink server, and credentials appropriate for retrieving a user's ACLs from that machine.  Since LiveLink operates with its own list of users, you
                    may also want to specify a rule-based mapping between an Active Directory user and the corresponding LiveLink user.  The authority type allows you to specify such a mapping using
                    regular expressions.</p>
<p>A LiveLink authority connection has two special tabs you will need to configure: the "Server" tab, and the "User Mapping" tab.</p>
<p>The "Server" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Authority, Server tab" src="images/livelink-authority-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the name of the desired LiveLink server, the LiveLink port, and the LiveLink credentials.</p>
<p>The "User Mapping" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Authority, User Mapping tab" src="images/livelink-authority-user-mapping.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The purpose of the "User Mapping" tab is to allow you to map the incoming user name and domain (usually from Active Directory) to its LiveLink equivalent.
                       The mapping consists of a match expression, which is a regular expression where parentheses ("("
                       and ")") mark sections you are interested in, and a replace string.  The sections marked with parentheses are called "groups" in regular expression parlance.  The replace string consists of constant text plus
                       substitutions of the groups from the match, perhaps modified.  For example, "$(1)" refers to the first group within the match, while "$(1l)" refers to the first match group
                       mapped to lower case.  Similarly, "$(1u)" refers to the same characters, but mapped to upper case.</p>
<p>For example, a match expression of <span class="codefrag">^(.*)\@([A-Z|a-z|0-9|_|-]*)\.(.*)$</span> with a replace string of <span class="codefrag">$(2)\$(1l)</span> would convert an AD username of
                    <span class="codefrag">MyUserName@subdomain.domain.com</span> into the LiveLink user name <span class="codefrag">subdomain\myusername</span>.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button.  You will then see a summary and status for the authority connection:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Authority Status" src="images/livelink-authority-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>We suggest that you examine the status carefully and correct any reported errors before proceeding.  Note that in this example, the LiveLink server would not accept connections, which
                    is leading to an error status message instead of "Connection working".</p>
<a name="N10493"></a><a name="documentumauthority"></a>
<h3 class="h4">EMC Documentum Authority Connection</h3>
<p>A Documentum authority connection is required for enforcing security for documents retrieved from Documentum repositories.</p>
<p>This connection type needs to be provided with information about what Content Server to connect to, and the credentials that should be used to retrieve a user's ACLs from that machine.
                    In addition, you can also specify whether or not you wish to include auto-generated ACLs in every user's list.  Auto-generated ACLs are created within Documentum for every folder
                    object.  Because there are often a very large number of folders, including these ACLs can bloat the number of ManifoldCF access tokens returned for a user to tens of thousands, which can negatively
                    impact perfomance.  Even more notably, few Documentum installations make any real use of these ACLs in any way.  Since Documentum's ACLs are purely additive (that is, there are no
                    mechanisms for 'deny' semantics), the impact of a missing ACLs is only to block a user from seeing something they otherwise could see.  It is thus safe, and often desirable, to simply ignore the
                    existence of these auto-generated ACLs.</p>
<p>A Documentum authority connection has three special tabs you will need to configure: the "Docbase" tab, the "User Mapping" tab, and the "System ACLs" tab.</p>
<p>The "Docbase" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Documentum Authority, Docbase tab" src="images/documentum-authority-docbase.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the desired Content Server docbase name, and enter the appropriate credentials.  You may leave the "Domain" field blank if the Content Server you specify does not have
                    Active Directory support enabled.</p>
<p>The "User Mapping" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Documentum Authority, User Mapping tab" src="images/documentum-authority-user-mapping.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Here you can specify whether the mapping between incoming user names and Content Server user names is case sensitive or case insensitive.  No other mappings
                    are currently permitted.  Typically, Documentum instances operate in conjunction with Active Directory, such that Documentum user names are either the same as the Active Directory user names,
                    or are the Active Directory user names mapped to all lower case characters.  You may need to consult with your Documentum system administrator to decide what the correct setting should be for
                    this option.</p>
<p>The "System ACLs" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Documentum Authority, System ACLs tab" src="images/documentum-authority-system-acls.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Here, you can choose to ignore all auto-generated ACLs associated with a user.  We recommend that you try ignoring such ACLs, and only choose the default if you have
                    reason to believe that your Documentum content is protected in a significant way by the use of auto-generated ACLs.  Your may need to consult with your Documentum system administrator to
                    decide what the proper setting should be for this option.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button.  When you do, a connection summary and status screen will be presented:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Documentum Authority Status" src="images/documentum-authority-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>

<h3 class="h4">Memex Patriarch Authority Connection</h3>
<p>A Memex authority connection is required for enforcing security for documents retrieved from Memex repositories.</p>
<p>This connection type needs to be provided with information about what Memex Server to connect to, and what user mapping to perform.
                    Also needed are the Memex credentials that should be used to retrieve a user's permissions from the Memex server.</p>
<p>A Memex authority connection has the following special tabs you will need to configure: the "Memex Server" tab, and the "User Mapping" tab.  The "Memex Server" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Memex Authority, Memex Server tab" src="images/memex-authority-memex-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You must supply the name of your Memex server, and the connection port, along with the Memex credentials for a user that has sufficient permissions to retrieve Memex user
                    information.  You must also select the Memex server's character encoding.  If you do not know the encoding, consult your Memex system administrator.</p>
<p>The "User Mapping" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Memex Authority, User Mapping tab" src="images/memex-authority-user-mapping.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The purpose of the "User Mapping" tab is to allow you to map the incoming user name and domain (usually from Active Directory) to its Memex equivalent.
                       The mapping consists of a match expression, which is a regular expression where parentheses ("("
                       and ")") mark sections you are interested in, and a replace string.  The sections marked with parentheses are called "groups" in regular expression parlance.  The replace string consists of constant text plus
                       substitutions of the groups from the match, perhaps modified.  For example, "$(1)" refers to the first group within the match, while "$(1l)" refers to the first match group
                       mapped to lower case.  Similarly, "$(1u)" refers to the same characters, but mapped to upper case.</p>
<p>For example, a match expression of <span class="codefrag">^(.*)\@([A-Z|a-z|0-9|_|-]*)\.(.*)$</span> with a replace string of <span class="codefrag">$(2)\$(1l)</span> would convert an AD username of
                    <span class="codefrag">MyUserName@subdomain.domain.com</span> into the Memex user name <span class="codefrag">subdomain\myusername</span>.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button.  You will then see a summary and status for the authority connection:</p>

<h3 class="h4">Autonomy Meridio Authority Connection</h3>
<p>A Meridio authority connection is required for enforcing security for documents retrieved from Meridio repositories.</p>
<p>This connection type needs to be provided with information about what Document Server to connect to, what Records Server to connect to, and what User Service Server
                    to connect to.  Also needed are the Meridio credentials that should be used to retrieve a user's ACLs from those machines.</p>
<p>Note that the User Service is part of the Meridio Authority, and must be installed somewhere in the Meridio system in order for the Meridio Authority to function correctly.
                    If you do not know whether this has yet been done, or on what server, please ask your system administrator.</p>
<p>A Meridio authority connection has the following special tabs you will need to configure: the "Document Server" tab, the "Records Server" tab, the "User Service Server" tab,

<br>
<p>Enter the Meridio server credentials needed to access the Meridio system.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button.  You will then see a screen looking something like this:</p>

<img id="" class="figure" alt="Meridio Authority Status" src="images/meridio-authority-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>In this example, logon has not succeeded because the server on which the Meridio Authority is running is unknown to the Windows domain under which Meridio is running.
                    This results in an error message, instead of the "Connection working" message that you would see if the authority was working properly.</p>
<p>Since Meridio uses Windows IIS for authentication, there are many ways in which the configuration of either IIS or the Windows domain under which Meridio runs can affect
                    the correct functioning of the Meridio Authority.  It is beyond the scope of this manual to describe the kinds of analysis and debugging techniques that might be required to diagnose connection
                    and authentication problems.  If you have trouble, you will almost certainly need to involve your Meridio IT personnel.  Debugging tools may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Windows security event logs</li>
                    
<li>ManifoldCF logs (see below)</li>
                    
<li>Packet captures (using a tool such as WireShark)</li>

<h3 class="h4">Generic File System Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The generic file system repository connection type was developed primarily as an example, demonstration, and testing tool, although it can potentially be useful for indexing local
                       files that exist on the same machine that ManifoldCF is running on.  Bear in mind that there is no support in this connection type for any kind of
                       security, and the options are somewhat limited.</p>
<p>The file system repository connection type provides no configuration tabs beyond the standard ones.  However, please consider setting a "Maximum connections per
                       JVM" value on the "Throttling" tab to at least one per worker thread, or 30, for best performance.</p>
<p>Jobs created using a file-system-type repository connection
                       have two tabs in addition to the standard repertoire: the "Hop Filters" tab, and the "Paths" tab.</p>
<p>The "Hop Filters" tab allows you to restrict the document set by the number of child hops from the path root.  While this is not terribly interesting in the case of a file
                       system, the same basic functionality is also used in the Web connection type, where it is a more important feature.  The file system connection type gives you a way to see
                       how this feature works, in a more predictable environment:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="File System Connection, Hop Filters tab" src="images/filesystem-job-hopcount.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the case of the file system connection type, there is only one variety of relationship between documents, which is called a "child" relationship.  If you want to
                       restrict the document set by how far away a document is from the path root, enter the maximum allowed number of hops in the text box.  Leaving the box blank
                       indicates that no such filtering will take place.</p>
<p>On this same tab, you can tell the Framework what to do should there be changes in the distance from the root to a document.  The choice "Delete unreachable
                       documents" requires the Framework to recalculate the distance to every potentially affected document whenever a change takes place.  This may require
                       expensive bookkeeping, however, so you also have the option of  ignoring such changes.  There are two varieties of this latter option - you can ignore the changes
                       for now, with the option of turning back on the aggressive bookkeeping at a later time, or you can decide not to ever allow changes to propagate, in which case
                       the Framework will discard the necessary bookkeeping information permanently.</p>
<p>The "Paths" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="File System Connection, Paths tab" src="images/filesystem-job-paths.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>This tab allows you to type in a set of paths which function as the roots of the crawl.  For each desired path, type in the path and click the "Add" button to add it to
                       the list.  The form of the path you type in obviously needs to be meaningful for the operating system the Framework is running on.</p>
<p>Each root path has a set of rules which determines whether a document is included or not in the set for the job.  Once you have added the root path to the list, you
                       may then add rules to it.  Each rule has a match expression, an indication of whether the rule is intended to match files or directories, and an action (include or exclude).
                       Rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first rule that matches the file name is the one that is chosen.  To add a rule, select the desired pulldowns, type in 
                       a match file specification (e.g. "*.txt"), and click the "Add" button.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Generic RSS Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The RSS connection type is specifically designed to crawl RSS feeds.  While the Web connection type can also extract links from RSS feeds, the RSS connection type
                       differs in the following ways:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Links are <b>only</b> extracted from feeds</li>
                    
<li>Feeds themselves are not indexed</li>
                    
<li>There is fine-grained control over how often feeds are refetched, and they are treated distinctly from documents in this regard</li>
                    
<li>The RSS connection type knows how to carry certain data down from the feeds to individual documents, as metadata</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>Many users of the RSS connection type set up their jobs to run continuously, configuring their jobs to never refetch documents, but rather to expire them after some 30 days.
                       This model works reasonably well for news, which is what RSS is often used for.</p>
<p>An RSS connection has the following special tabs: "Email", "Robots", "Bandwidth", and "Proxy".  The "Email" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS Connection, Email tab" src="images/rss-configure-email.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter an email address.  This email address will be included in all requests made by the RSS connection, so that webmasters can report any difficulties that their
                       sites experience as the result of improper throttling, etc.</p>
<p>This field is mandatory.  While an RSS connection makes no effort to validate the correctness of the email
                       field, you will probably want to remain a good web citizen and provide a valid email address.  Remember that it is very easy for a webmaster to block access to
                       a crawler that does not seem to be behaving in a polite manner.</p>
<p>The "Robots" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS Connection, Robots tab" src="images/rss-configure-robots.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select how the connection will interpret robots.txt.  Remember that you have an interest in crawling people's sites as politely as is possible.</p>
<p>The "Bandwidth" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS Connection, Bandwidth tab" src="images/rss-configure-bandwidth.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>This tab allows you to control the <b>maximum</b> rate at which the connection fetches data, on a per-server basis, as well as the <b>maximum</b> fetches per minute,
                       also per-server.  Finally, the maximum number of socket connections made per server at any one time is also controllable by this tab.</p>
<p>The screen shot displays parameters that are
                       considered reasonably polite.  The default values for this table are all blank, meaning that, by default, there is no throttling whatsoever!  Please do not make the mistake
                       of crawling other people's sites without adequate politeness parameters in place.</p>
<p>The "Throttle group" parameter allows you to treat multiple RSS-type connections together, for the purposes of throttling.  All RSS-type connections that have the same
                       throttle group name will use the same pool for throttling purposes.</p>
<p>The "Bandwidth" tab is related to the throttles that you can set on the "Throttling" tab in the following ways:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>The "Bandwidth" tab sets the <b>maximum</b> values, while the "Throttling" tab sets the <b>average</b> values.</li>
                    
<li>The "Bandwidth" tab does not affect how documents are scheduled in the queue; it simply blocks documents until it is safe to go ahead, which will use up a crawler thread
                           for the entire period that both the wait and the fetch take place.  The "Throttling" tab affects how often documents are scheduled, so it does not waste threads.</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>Because of the above, we suggest that you configure your RSS connection using <b>both</b> the "Bandwidth" <b>and</b> the "Throttling" tabs.  Select maximum
                       values on the "Bandwidth" tab, and corresponding average values estimates on the "Throttling" tab.  Remember that a document identifier for an RSS connection is the
                       document's URL, and the bin name for that URL is the server name.  Also, please note that the "Maximum number of connections per JVM" field's default value of 10 is
                       unlikely to be correct for connections of the RSS type; you should have at least one available connection per worker thread, for best performance.  Since the
                       default number of worker threads is 30, you should set this parameter to at least a value of 30 for normal operation.</p>
<p>The "Proxy" tab allows you to specify a proxy that you want to crawl through.  The RSS connection type supports proxies that are secured with all forms of the NTLM
                       authentication method.  This is quite typical of large organizations.  The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS Connection, Proxy tab" src="images/rss-configure-proxy.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the proxy server you will be proxying through in the "Proxy host" field.  Enter the proxy port in the "Proxy port" field.  If your server is authenticated, enter the
                       domain, username, and password in the corresponding fields.  Leave all fields blank if you want to use no proxy whatsoever.</p>
<p>When you save your RSS connection, you should see a status screen that looks something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS Status" src="images/rss-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>Jobs created using connections of the RSS type have the following additional tabs: "URLs", "Canonicalization", "Mappings", "Time Values", "Security", "Metadata", and
                       "Dechromed Content".  The URLs tab is where you describe the feeds that are part of the job.  It looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS job, URLs tab" src="images/rss-job-urls.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the list of feed URLs you want to crawl, separated by newlines.  You may also have comments by starting lines with ("#") characters.</p>
<p>The "Canonicalization" tab controls how the job handles url canonicalization.  Canonicalization refers to the fact that many different URLs may all refer to the
                       same actual resource.  For example, arguments in URLs can often be reordered, so that <span class="codefrag">a=1&amp;b=2</span> is in fact the same as
                       <span class="codefrag">b=2&amp;a=1</span>.  Other canonical operations include removal of session cookies, which some dynamic web sites include in the URL.</p>
<p>The "Canonicalization" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS job, Canonicalization tab" src="images/rss-job-canonicalization.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The tab displays a list of canonicalization rules.  Each rule consists of a regular expression (which is matched against a document's URL), and some switch selections.
                       The switch selections allow you to specify whether arguments are reordered, or whether certain specific kinds of session cookies are removed.  Specific kinds of
                       session cookies that are recognized and can be removed are: JSP (Java applications servers), ASP (.NET), PHP, and Broadvision (BV).</p>
<p>If a URL matches more than one rule, the first matching rule is the one selected.</p>
<p>To add a rule, enter an appropriate regular expression, and make your checkbox selections, then click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>The "Mappings" tab permits you to change the URL under which documents that are fetched will get indexed.  This is sometimes useful in an intranet setting because
                       the crawling server might have open access to content, while the users may have restricted access through a somewhat different URL.  The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS job, Mappings tab" src="images/rss-job-mappings.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The "Mappings" tab uses the same regular expression/replacement string paradigm as is used by many connection types running under the Framework.
                       The mappings consist of a list of rules.  Each rule has a match expression, which is a regular expression where parentheses ("("
                       and ")") mark sections you are interested in.  These sections are called "groups" in regular expression parlance.  The replace string consists of constant text plus
                       substitutions of the groups from the match, perhaps modified.  For example, "$(1)" refers to the first group within the match, while "$(1l)" refers to the first match group
                       mapped to lower case.  Similarly, "$(1u)" refers to the same characters, but mapped to upper case.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had a rule which had "http://(.*)/(.*)/" as a match expression, and "http://$(2)/" as the replace string.  If presented with the path
                       <span class="codefrag">http://Server/Folder_1/Filename</span>, it would output the string <span class="codefrag">http://Folder_1/Filename</span>.</p>
<p>If more than one rule is present, the rules are all executed in sequence.  That is, the output of the first rule is modified by the second rule, etc.</p>
<p>To add a rule, fill in the match expression and output string, and click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>The "Time Values" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS job, Time Values tab" src="images/rss-job-time-values.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Fill in the desired time values.  A description of each value is below.</p>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
                    
<tr>
<td><b>Value</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Feed connect timeout</td><td>How long to wait, in seconds, before giving up, when trying to connect to a server</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Default feed refetch time</td><td>If a feed specifies no refetch time, this is the time to use instead (in minutes)</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Minimum feed refetch time</td><td>Never refetch feeds faster than this specified time, regardless of what the feed says (in minutes)</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Bad feed refetch time</td><td>How long to wait before trying to refetch a feed that contains parsing errors (in minutes, empty is infinity)</td>
</tr>
                
</table>
<p>The "Security" tab allows you to assign access tokens to the documents indexed with this job.  In order to use it, you must first decide what authority connection to use
                       to secure these documents, and what the access tokens from that authority connection look like.  The tab itself looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS job, Security tab" src="images/rss-job-security.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>To add an access token, fill in the text box with the access token value, and click the "Add" button.  If there are no access tokens, security will be considered
                       to be "off" for the job.</p>
<p>The "Metadata" tab allows you to specify arbitrary metadata to be indexed along with every document from this job.  Documents from connections of the RSS type
                       already receive some metadata having to do with the feed that referenced them.  Specifically:</p>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
                    
<tr>
<td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Meaning</b></td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>PubDate</td><td>This contains the document origination time, in milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970.  The date is either obtained from the feed, or if it is
                                                                absent, the date of fetch is included instead.</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Source</td><td>This is the name of the feed that referred to the document.</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Title</td><td>This is the title of the document within the feed.</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Category</td><td>This is the category of the document within the feed.</td>
</tr>
                
</table>
<p>You can add additional metadata to each document using the "Metadata" tab.  The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS job, Metadata tab" src="images/rss-job-metadata.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the name of the metadata item you want on the left, and its desired value on the right, and click the "Add" button to add it to the metadata list.</p>
<p>The "Dechromed Content" tab allows you to index the description of the content from the feed, instead of the document's contents.  This is helpful when the
                       description of the documents in the feeds you are crawling is sufficient for indexing purposes, and the actual documents are full of navigation clutter or "chrome".
                       The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="RSS job, Dechromed Content tab" src="images/rss-job-dechromed-content.PNG" width="80%"></div>

<h3 class="h4">Generic Web Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The Web connection type is effectively a reasonably full-featured web crawler.  It is capable of handling most kinds of authentication (basic, all forms of NTLM,
                       and session-based), and can extract links from the following kinds of documents:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Text</li>
                    
<li>HTML</li>
                    
<li>Generic XML</li>
                    
<li>RSS feeds</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>The Web connection type differs from the RSS connection type in the following respects:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Feeds are indexed, if the output connection accepts them</li>
                    
<li>Links are extracted from all documents, not just feeds</li>
                    
<li>Feeds are treated just like any other kind of document - you cannot control how often they refetch independently</li>
                    
<li>There is support for limiting crawls based on hop count</li>
                    
<li>There is support for controlling exactly what URLs are considered part of the set, and which are excluded</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>In other words, the Web connection type is neither as easy to configure, nor as well-targeted in its separation of links and data, as the RSS connection type.  For that
                       reason, we strongly encourage you to consider using the RSS connection type for all applications where it might reasonably apply.</p>
<p>Many users of the Web connection type set up their jobs to run continuously, configuring their jobs to occasionally refetch documents, or to not refetch documents
                       ever, and expire them after some period of time.</p>
<p>A Web connection has the following special tabs: "Email", "Robots", "Bandwidth", "Access Credentials", and "Certificates".  The "Email" tab
                       looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Connection, Email tab" src="images/web-configure-email.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter an email address.  This email address will be included in all requests made by the Web connection, so that webmasters can report any difficulties that their
                       sites experience as the result of improper throttling, etc.</p>
<p>This field is mandatory.  While a Web connection makes no effort to validate the correctness of the email
                       field, you will probably want to remain a good web citizen and provide a valid email address.  Remember that it is very easy for a webmaster to block access to
                       a crawler that does not seem to be behaving in a polite manner.</p>
<p>The "Robots" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Connection, Robots tab" src="images/web-configure-robots.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select how the connection will interpret robots.txt.  Remember that you have an interest in crawling people's sites as politely as is possible.</p>
<p>The "Bandwidth" tab allows you to specify a list of bandwidth rules.  Each rule has a regular expression matched against a URL's throttle bin.
                       Throttle bins, in connections of the Web type, are simply the server name part of the URL.  Each rule allows you to select a maximum bandwidth, number of
                       connections, and fetch rate.  You can have as many rules as you like; if a URL matches more than one rule, then the most conservative value will be used.</p>
<p>This is what the "Bandwidth" tab looks like:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Connection, Bandwidth tab" src="images/web-configure-bandwidth.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The screen shot shows the tab configured with a setting that is reasonably polite.  The default value for this tab is blank, meaning that, by default, there is no throttling
                       whatsoever!  Please do not make the mistake of crawling other people's sites without adequate politeness parameters in place.</p>
<p>To add a rule, fill in the regular expression and the appropriate rule limit values, and click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>The "Bandwidth" tab is related to the throttles that you can set on the "Throttling" tab in the following ways:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>The "Bandwidth" tab sets the <b>maximum</b> values, while the "Throttling" tab sets the <b>average</b> values.</li>
                    
<li>The "Bandwidth" tab does not affect how documents are scheduled in the queue; it simply blocks documents until it is safe to go ahead, which will use up a crawler thread
                           for the entire period that both the wait and the fetch take place.  The "Throttling" tab affects how often documents are scheduled, so it does not waste threads.</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>Because of the above, we suggest that you configure your Web connection using <b>both</b> the "Bandwidth" <b>and</b> the "Throttling" tabs.  Select maximum
                       values on the "Bandwidth" tab, and corresponding average values estimates on the "Throttling" tab.  Remember that a document identifier for a Web connection is the
                       document's URL, and the bin name for that URL is the server name.  Also, please note that the "Maximum number of connections per JVM" field's default value of 10 is
                       unlikely to be correct for connections of the Web type; you should have at least one available connection per worker thread, for best performance.  Since the
                       default number of worker threads is 30, you should set this parameter to at least a value of 30 for normal operation.</p>
<p>The Web connection's "Access Credentials" tab describes how pages get authenticated.  There is support on this tab for both page-based authentication (e.g.
                       basic auth or all forms of NTLM), as well as session-based authentication (which involves the fetch of many pages to establish a logged-in session).  The initial
                       appearance of the "Access Credentials" tab shows both kinds of authentication:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Connection, Access Credentials tab" src="images/web-configure-access-credentials.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Each kind of authentication has its own list of rules.</p>
<p>Specifying a page authentication rule requires simply knowing what URLs are protected, and what the proper
                       authentication method and credentials are for those URLs.  Enter a regular expression describing the protected URLs, and select the proper authentication method.
                       Fill in the credentials.  Click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>Specifying a correct session authentication rule usually requires some research.  A single session-authentication rule usually corresponds to a single session-protected
                       site.  For that site, you will need to be able to describe the following for session authentication to function:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>The URLs of pages that are protected by this particular site session security</li>
                    
<li>How to detect when a page fetch is part of the login sequence</li>
                    
<li>How to fill in the appropriate forms within the login sequence with appropriate login information</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>A Web connection labels pages that are part of the login sequence "login pages", and pages that are protected site content "content pages".  A Web
                       connection will not attempt to index login pages.  They are special pages that have but one purpose: establishing an authenticated session.</p>
<p>If all this is not complicated enough, your research also has to cover two very different cases: when you are first entering the site anew, and second when you try to fetch
                       a content page and you are no longer logged in, because your session has expired.  In both cases, the session authentication rule must be able to properly log in and
                       fetch content, because you cannot control when a page will be fetched or refetched by the Framework.</p>
<p>You declare a page to be a login page by identifying it both by its URL, and by what the crawler finds on the page when it fetches it.  For example, some session-protected
                       sites may redirect you to a login screen when your session expires.  So, instead of fetching content, you would be fetching a redirection to a specific page.  You do <b>not</b>
                       want either the redirection, or the login screen, to be considered content pages.  The correct way to handle such a setup would be to declare one kind of login page to consist
                       of a redirection to the login screen URL, and another kind of login page to consist of the login screen URL with the appropriate form.  Furthermore, you would want to supply
                       the correct login data for the form, and allow the form to be submitted, and so the login form's target may also need to be declared as a login page.</p>
<p>The kinds of content that a Web connection can recognize as a login page are the following:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>A redirection to a specific URL, as described by a regular expression</li>
                    
<li>A page that has a form of a particular name on it, as described by a regular expression</li>
                    
<li>A page that has a link on it to a specific target, as described by a regular expression</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>To add a session authentication rule, fill in a regular expression describing the site pages that are being protected, and click the "Add" button:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Connection, Access Credentials tab" src="images/web-configure-access-credentials-session.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note that you can now add login page descriptions to the newly-created rule.  To add a login page description, enter a URL regular expression, a type of login page, a
                       target link or form name regular expression, and click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>When you add a login page of the "form" type, you can then add form fill-in information to the login page, as seen below:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Connection, Access Credentials tab" src="images/web-configure-access-credentials-session-form.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Supply a regular expression for the name of the form element you want to set, and also provide a value.  If you want the value to not be visible in clear text, fill in the
                       "password" column instead of the "value" column.  You can usually figure out the name of the form and its elements by viewing the source of the HTML page in a
                       browser.  When you are done, click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>Form data that is not specified will be posted with the default value determined by the HTML of the page.  The Web connection type is unable, at this time, to execute
                       Javascript, and therefore you may need to fill out some form values that are filled in by Javascript in order to get the form to post in a useful way.  If you have a form
                       that relies heavily on Javascript to post properly, you may need considerable effort and web programming skills to figure out how to get these forms to post properly
                       with a Web connection.  Luckily, such obfuscated login screens are still rare.</p>
<p>A series of login pages form a "login page sequence" for the site.  For each login page, the Web connection decides what page to fetch next by what you specified for
                       the login page criteria.  So, for a redirection to a specific URL, the next page to be fetched will be that redirected URL.  For a form, the next page fetched will be the
                       action page indicated by the specified form.  For a link to a target, the next page fetched will be the target URL.  When the login page sequence ends, the next page
                       fetched after that will be the original content page that the Web connection was trying to fetch when the login sequence started.</p>
<p>Debugging session authentication problems is best done by looking at a Simple History report for your Web connection.  A Web connection records several
                       types of events which, between them, can give a very strong picture of what is happening.  These event types are as follows:</p>
<br>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
                    
<tr>
<td><b>Event type</b></td><td><b>Meaning</b></td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Fetch</td><td>This event records the fetch of a URL.  The HTTP response is recorded as the response code.  In addition, there are several negative
                        code values which the connect generates when the HTTP operation cannot be done or does not complete.</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>Begin login</td><td>This event occurs when the connection detects the transition to a login page sequence.  When a login sequence is entered, no other
                        pages from that protected site will be fetched until the login sequence is completed.</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>End login</td><td>This event occurs when the connection detects the transition from a login page sequence back to normal content fetching.  When this
                        occurs, simultaneous fetching for pages from the site are re-enabled.</td>
</tr>
                
</table>
<br>
<p>The "Certificates" tab is used in conjunction with SSL, and permits you to define independent trust certificate stores for URLs matching specified regular expressions.
                       You can also allow the connection to trust all certificates it sees, if you so choose.  The "Certificates" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Connection, Certificates tab" src="images/web-configure-certificates.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Type in a URL regular expression, and either check the "Trust everything" box, or browse for the appropriate certificate authority certificate that you wish to trust.  (It will
                       also work to simply trust a server's certificate, but that certificate may change from time to time, as it expires.)  Click "Add" to add the certificate rule to the list.</p>
<p>When you are done, and you click the "Save" button, you will see a summary page looking something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Status" src="images/web-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>When you create a job that uses a repository connection of the Web type, the tabs "Hop Filters", "Seeds", "Canonicalization", "Inclusions", "Exclusions", "Security", and "Metadata"
                       will all appear.  These tabs allow you to configure the job appropriately for a web crawl.</p>
<p>The "Hop Filters" tab allows you to specify the maximum number of hops from a seed document that a document can be before it is no longer considered to be part of the job.
                       For connections of the Web type, there are two different kinds of hops you can count as well: "link" hops, and "redirection" hops.  Each of these represents an independent count
                       and cutoff value.  A blank value means no cutoff value at all.</p>
<p>For example, if you specified a maximum "link" hop count of 5, and left the "redirect" hop count blank, then any document that requires more than five links to reach from a seed
                       will be considered out-of-set.  If you specified both a maximum "link" hop count of 5, and a maximum "redirect" hop count 2, then any document that requires more than five links to
                       reach from a seed, <b>and</b> more than two redirections, will be considered out-of-set.</p>
<p>The "Hop Filters" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Job, Hop Filters tab" src="images/web-job-hop-filters.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>On this same tab, you can tell the Framework what to do should there be changes in the distance from the root to a document.  The choice "Delete unreachable
                       documents" requires the Framework to recalculate the distance to every potentially affected document whenever a change takes place.  This may require
                       expensive bookkeeping, however, so you also have the option of  ignoring such changes.  There are two varieties of this latter option - you can ignore the changes
                       for now, with the option of turning back on the aggressive bookkeeping at a later time, or you can decide not to ever allow changes to propagate, in which case
                       the Framework will discard the necessary bookkeeping information permanently.  This last option is the most efficient.</p>
<p>The "Seeds" tab is where you enter the starting points for your crawl.  It looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Job, Seeds tab" src="images/web-job-seeds.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter a list of seeds, separated by newline characters.  Blank lines, or lines that begin with a "#' character, will be ignored.</p>
<p>The "Canonicalization" tab controls how a web job converts URLs into a standard form.  It looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Job, Canonicalization tab" src="images/web-job-canonicalization.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The tab displays a list of canonicalization rules.  Each rule consists of a regular expression (which is matched against a document's URL), and some switch selections.
                       The switch selections allow you to specify whether arguments are reordered, or whether certain specific kinds of session cookies are removed.  Specific kinds of
                       session cookies that are recognized and can be removed are: JSP (Java applications servers), ASP (.NET), PHP, and Broadvision (BV).</p>
<p>If a URL matches more than one rule, the first matching rule is the one selected.</p>
<p>To add a rule, enter an appropriate regular expression, and make your checkbox selections, then click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>The "Inclusions" tab lets you specify, by means of a set of regular expressions, exactly what URLs will be included as part of the document set for a web job.  The tab
                       looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Job, Inclusions tab" src="images/web-job-inclusions.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You will need to provide a series of zero or more regular expressions, separated by newlines.</p>
<p>Remember that, by default, a web job includes <b>all</b> documents in the world that are linked to your seeds in any way that the web connection type can determine.</p>
<p>If you wish to restrict which documents are actually processed within your overall set of included documents, you may want to supply some regular expressions on the
                       "Exclusions" tab, which looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Job, Exclusions tab" src="images/web-job-exclusions.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Once again you will need to provide a series of zero or more regular expressions, separated by newlines.  It is typical to use the "Exclusions" tab to remove documents from
                       consideration which are suspected to contain content that both has no extractable links, and is not useful to the index you are trying to build, e.g. movie files.</p>
<p>The "Security" tab allows you to specify the access tokens that the documents in the web job get indexed with, and looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Job, Security tab" src="images/web-job-security.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You will need to know the format of the access tokens for the
                       governing authority before you can add security to your documents in this way.  Enter the access token you desire and click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>The "Metadata" tab allows you to include specified metadata along with all documents belonging to a web job.  It looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Web Job, Metadata tab" src="images/web-job-metadata.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the name of the desired metadata on the left, and the desired value (if any) on the right, and click the "Add" button.</p>
<a name="N10958"></a><a name="jcifsrepository"></a>
<h3 class="h4">Windows Share/DFS Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The Windows Share connection type allows you to access content stored on Windows shares, even from non-Windows systems.  Also supported are Samba and various
                       third-party Network Attached Storage servers.</p>
<p>DFS nodes and referrals are fully supported, provided the referral machine names can be looked up properly via DNS on the server where the Framework is
                       running.  For each document, a Windows Share connection creates an index identifier that can be either a "file:" IRI's, or a mapped "http:" URI's, depending on how it is
                       configured.  This allows for a great deal of flexibility in deployment environments, but also may require some work to properly set up.
                       In particular, if you intend to use file IRI's as your identifiers, you should check with your system integrator to be sure these are being handled properly by the search component of your
                       system.  When you use a browser such as Internet Explorer to view a document from a Windows file system called <span class="codefrag">\\servername\sharename\dir1\filename.txt</span>,
                       the browser converts that to an IRI that looks something like this: <span class="codefrag">file://///servername/sharename/dir1/filename.txt</span>.
                       While this seems simple, major complexities arise when the underlying file name has special characters in it, such as spaces, "#" symbols, or worse still, non-ASCII
                       characters.  Unfortunately, every version of Internet Explorer handles these situations somewhat differently, so there is not any fully correct way for the Windows
                       Share connection type to convert file names to IRI's.  Instead, the connection always uses a standard canonical form, and expects the search results display system component to know how to properly form
                       the right IRI for the browser or client being used.</p>
<p>If you are interested in enforcing security for documents crawled with a Windows Share repository connection, you will need to first configure an authority connection
                       of the Active Directory type to control access to these documents.</p>
<p>A Windows Share connection has a single special tab on the repository connection editing screen: the "Server" tab:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Connection, Server tab" src="images/jcifs-configure-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You must enter the name of the server to form the connection with in the "Server" field.  This can either be an actual machine name, or a domain name (if you intend
                       to connect to a Windows domain-based DFS root).  If you supply an actual machine name, it is usually the right thing to do to provide the server name in an unqualified
                       form, and provide a fully-qualified domain name in the "Domain name" field.  The user name also should usually be unqualified, e.g. "Administrator" rather than
                       "Administrator@mydomain.com".  Sometimes it may work to leave the "Domain name" field blank, and instead supply a fully-qualified machine name in the "Server"
                       field.  It never works to supply both a domain name <b>and</b> a fully-qualified server name.</p>
<p>Please note that you should probably set the "Maximum number of connections per JVM" field, on the "Throttling" tab, to a number smaller than the default value of
                       10, because Windows is not especially good at handling multithreaded file requests.  A number less than 5 is likely to perform as well with less chance of causing
                       server-side problems.</p>
<p>After you click the "Save" button, you will see a connection summary screen, which might look something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Status" src="images/jcifs-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note that in this example, the Windows Share connection is not responding, which is leading to an error status message instead of "Connection working".</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you configure a job to use a repository connection of the Windows Share type, several additional tabs are presented.  These are, in order, "Paths", "Security",
                       "Metadata", "Content Length", "File Mapping", and "URL Mapping".</p>
<p>The "Paths" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Job, Paths tab" src="images/jcifs-job-paths.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>This tab allows you to construct starting-point paths by drilling down, and then add the constructed paths to a list, or remove existing paths from the list.  Without any
                       starting paths, your job includes zero documents.</p>
<p>Make sure your connection has a status of "Connection working" before you open this tab, or you will see an error message, and you will not be able to build
                       any paths.</p>
<p>For each included path, a list of rules is displayed which determines what folders and documents get included with the job.  These rules
                       will be evaluated from top to bottom, in order.  Whichever rule first matches a given path is the one that will be used for that path.</p>
<p>Each rule describes the path matching criteria.  This consists of the file specification (e.g. "*.txt"), whether the path is a file or folder name, and whether a file is
                       considered indexable or not by the output connection.  The rule also describes the action to take should the rule be matched: include or exclude.  The file specification
                       character "*" is a wildcard which matches zero or more characters, while the character "?" matches exactly one character.  All other characters must match 
                       exactly.</p>
<p>To add a rule for a starting path, select the desired values of all the pulldowns, type in the desired file criteria, and click the "Add" button.  You may also insert
                       a new rule above any existing rule, by using one of the "Insert" buttons.</p>
<p>The "Security" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Job, Security tab" src="images/jcifs-job-security.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The "Security" tab lets you control three things: File security, share security, and (if security is off) the security tokens attached to all documents indexed by the job.</p>
<p>
<b>File security</b> is the security Windows applies to individual files.  This kind of security is supported by practically all Windows-compatible NAS-type servers,
                       so you may use this feature without cause for concern.</p>
<p>
<b>Share security</b> is the security Windows applies to Windows shares.  This is an older kind of security that is no longer prevalent in most enterprise organizations.
                       Many modern NAS systems and Samba also do not support this security model.  If you enable this kind of security in your job while crawling against a system that
                       does not support it, your job will not run correctly; the first document access will cause an error, and the job will abort.</p>
<p>If you turn off file security, you have the option of adding index access tokens of your own to all documents crawled by the job.  These tokens must, of course, be
                       in a form appropriate for the governing authority connection.  Type the token into the box and click the "Add" button.  It is unusual to use this feature other
                       than for demonstrations.</p>
<p>The "Metadata" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Job, Metadata tab" src="images/jcifs-job-metadata.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>This tab allows you to ingest a document's path, as modified by a set of regular expression rules, as a piece of document metadata.  Enter the metadata name you want
                       in the "Path attribute name" field.  Then, add the rules you want to the list of rules.  Each rule has a match expression, which is a regular expression where parentheses ("("
                       and ")") mark sections you are interested in.  These sections are called "groups" in regular expression parlance.  The replace string consists of constant text plus
                       substitutions of the groups from the match, perhaps modified.  For example, "$(1)" refers to the first group within the match, while "$(1l)" refers to the first match group
                       mapped to lower case.  Similarly, "$(1u)" refers to the same characters, but mapped to upper case.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had a rule which had ".*/(.*)/(.*)/.*" as a match expression, and "$(1) $(2)" as the replace string.  If presented with the path
                       <span class="codefrag">Project/Folder_1/Folder_2/Filename</span>, it would output the string <span class="codefrag">Folder_1 Folder_2</span>.</p>
<p>If more than one rule is present, the rules are all executed in sequence.  That is, the output of the first rule is modified by the second rule, etc.</p>
<p>The "Content Length tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Job, Content Length tab" src="images/jcifs-job-content-length.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>This tab allows you to set a maximum content length cutoff value, to avoid having the job try to index exceptionally large documents.  Enter the desired maximum value.
                       A blank value indicates an unlimited cutoff length.</p>
<p>The "File Mapping" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Job, File Mapping tab" src="images/jcifs-job-file-mapping.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The mappings specified here are similar in all respects to the path attribute mapping setup described above.  The mappings are applied to change the actual file path
                       discovered by the crawler into a different file path.  This can sometimes be useful if there is some kind of conversion process between raw documents and
                       parallel data files that contain extracted data.</p>
<p>The "URL Mapping" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Windows Share Job, URL Mapping tab" src="images/jcifs-job-url-mapping.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The mappings specified here are similar in all respects to the path attribute mapping setup described above.  If no mappings are present, the file path is converted
                       to a canonical file IRI.  If mappings are present, the conversion is presumed to produce a valid URL, which can be used to access the document via some
                       variety of Windows Share http server.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Generic Database Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The generic database connection type allows you to index content from a database table, served by one of the following databases:</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Postgresql (via a Postgresql JDBC driver)</li>
                    
<li>SQL Server (via the JTDS JDBC driver)</li>
                    
<li>Oracle (via the Oracle JDBC driver)</li>
                    
<li>Sybase (via the JTDS JDBC driver)</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>This connection type <b>cannot</b> be configured to work with other databases without software changes.  Depending on your particular installation,
                       some of the above options may not be available.</p>
<p>The generic database connection type currently has no per-document notion of security.  It is possible to set document security for all documents specified by a
                       given job.  Since this form of security requires you to know what the actual access tokens are, you must have detailed knowledge of the authority connection you
                       intend to use, and what sorts of access tokens it produces.</p>
<p>A generic database connection has three special tabs on the repository connection editing screen: the "Database Type" tab, the "Server" tab, and the
                       "Credentials" tab.  The "Database Type" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Generic Database Connection, Database Type tab" src="images/jdbc-configure-database-type.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the kind of database you want to connect to, from the pulldown.</p>
<p>The "Server" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Generic Database Connection, Server tab" src="images/jdbc-configure-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The server name and port must be provided in the "Database host and port" field.  For example, for Oracle, the standard Oracle installation uses port 1521, so you would
                       enter something like, "my-oracle-server:1521" for this field.  Postgresql uses port 5432 by default, so "my-postgresql-server:5432" would be required.  SQL Server's
                       standard port is 1433, so use "my-sql-server:1433".</p>
<p>The service name or instance name field describes which instance and database to connect to.  For Oracle or Postgresql, provide just the database name.  For SQL Server, use
                       "my-instance-name/my-database-name".  For SQL Server using the default instance, use just the database name.</p>
<p>The "Credentials" tab is straightforward:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Generic Database Connection, Credentials tab" src="images/jdbc-configure-credentials.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the database user credentials.</p>
<p>After you click the "Save" button, you will see a connection summary screen, which might look something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Generic Database Status" src="images/jdbc-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note that in this example, the generic database connection is not properly authenticated, which is leading to an error status message instead of "Connection working".</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you configure a job to use a repository connection of the generic database type, several additional tabs are presented.  These are, in order, "Queries", and "Security".</p>
<p>The "Queries" tab looks something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Generic Database Job, Queries tab" src="images/jdbc-job-queries.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You must supply at least two queries.  (A third query is optional.)  The purpose of these queries is to obtain the data needed for the database to be properly crawled.
                       But in order for you to write these queries, you must make some decisions first.  Basically, you need to figure out how best to map the constructs within your database
                       to the requirements of the Framework.</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Obtain a list of document identifiers corresponding to changes and additions that occurred within a specified time window (see below)</li>
                    
<li>Given a set of document identifiers, find the corresponding version strings (see below)</li>
                    
<li>Given a set of document identifiers and version strings, find information about the document, consisting of the document's data, access URL, and metadata</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>The Framework uses a unique document identifier to describe every document within the confines of a defined repository connection.  This document identifier is used
                       as a primary key to locate information about the document.  When you set up a generic-database-type job, the database you are connecting to must have a similar
                       concept.  If you pick the wrong thing for a document identifier, at the very least you could find that the crawler runs very slowly.</p>
<p>Obtaining the list of document identifiers that represents the changes that occurred over the given time frame must return <b>at least</b> all such changes.  It is
                        acceptable (although not ideal) for the returned list to be bigger than that.</p>
<p>If you want your database connection to function in an incremental manner, you must also come up with the format of a "version string".  This string is used by the 
                       Framework to determine if a document has changed.  It must change whenever anything that might affect the document's indexing changes.  (It is not a problem if
                       it changes for other reasons, as long as it fulfills that principle criteria.)</p>
<p>The queries you provide get substituted before they are used by the connection.  The example queries, which are present when the queries tab is first opened for a
                       new job, show many of these substitutions in roughly the manner in which they are intended to be used.  For example, "$(IDCOLUMN)" will substitute a column
                       name expected by the connection to contain the document identifier into the query.  The list of substitution strings are as follows:</p>
<br>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
                    
<tr>
<td><b>String name</b></td><td><b>Meaning/use</b></td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>IDCOLUMN</td><td>The name of an expected resultset column containing a document identifier</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>VERSIONCOLUMN</td><td>The name of an expected resultset column containing a version string</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>URLCOLUMN</td><td>The name of an expected resultset column containing a URL</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>DATACOLUMN</td><td>The name of an expected resultset column containing document data</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>STARTTIME</td><td>A query string value containing a start time in milliseconds since epoch</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>ENDTIME</td><td>A query string value containing an end time in milliseconds since epoch</td>
</tr>
                    
<tr>
<td>IDLIST</td><td>A query string value containing a parenthesized list of document identifier values</td>
</tr>
                
</table>
<br>
<p>Use caution when constructing queries that include time-based
                        components. "$(STARTTIME)" and "$(ENDTIME)" provide
                        times in milliseconds since epoch. If the modified date field is not
                        in this unit, the seeding query may not select the desired document
                        identifiers. You should convert "$(STARTTIME)" and
                        "$(ENDTIME)" to the appropriate timestamp unit for your system within your query.</p>
<p>The following table gives several sample query fragments that can be
                        used to convert the helper strings "$(STARTTIME)" and
                        "$(ENDTIME)" into other date and time types. The first column names
                        the SQL database type that the following query phrase corresponds to,
                        the second column names the output data type for the query phrase, and
                        the third gives the query phrase itself using "$(STARTTIME)"
                        as an example time in milliseconds since epoch. These query phrases
                        are intended as guidlines for creating an appropriate query phrase in
                        each language. Each query phrase is designed to work with the most
                        current version of the database software available at the time of
                        publishing for this document. If your modified date field is not of
                        the type given in the second column, the query phrase may not provide
                        an appropriate output for date comparisons.</p>
<br>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">

<p>When you create a job based on a general database connection, the job's queries are initially populated with examples.  These examples should give you a good idea of
                        what columns your queries should return - in most cases, the only columns you need to return are the ones that appear in the example queries.  However,
                        for the file data query, you may also return columns that are not specified in the example.  When you do this, the extra return column values will be passed
                        to the index as metadata for the document.  The metadata name used will be the corresponding column name of the resultset.</p>
<p>The "Security" tab simply allows you to add specific access tokens to all documents indexed with a general database job.  In order for you to know what tokens
                       to add, you must decide with what authority connection these documents will be secured, and understand the form of the access tokens used by that authority connection
                       type.  This is what the "Security" tab looks like:</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>More here later</p>
<a name="N10B65"></a><a name="documentumrepository"></a>
<h3 class="h4">EMC Documentum Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The EMC Documentum connection type allows you index content from a Documentum Content Server instance.  A single connection allows you
                    to reach all documents contained on a single Content Server instance.  Multiple connections are therefore required to reach documents from multiple Content Server instances.</p>
<p>For each Content Server instance, the Documentum connection type allows you to index any Documentum content that is of type dm_document, or is derived from dm_document.
                    Compound documents are handled as well, but only by mean of the component documents that make them up.  No other Documentum construct can be indexed at this time.</p>
<p>Documents described by Documentum connections are typically secured by a Documentum authority.  If you have not yet created a Documentum authority, but would like your
                    documents to be secured, please follow the direction in the section titled "EMC Documentum Authority Connection".</p>
<p>A Documentum connection has the following special tabs: "Docbase", and "Webtop".  The "Docbase" tab allows you to select a Content Server to connect to, and also to provide
                    appropriate credentials.  The "Webtop" tab describes the location of a Webtop server that will be used to display the documents from that Content Server, after they have been indexed.</p>
<p>The "Docbase" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Documentum Connection, Docbase tab" src="images/documentum-docbase.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the Content Server Docbase instance name, and provide your credentials.  You may leave the "Domain" field blank, if the Content Server instance does not have AD integration enabled.</p>
<p>The "Webtop tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Documentum Connection, Docbase tab" src="images/documentum-webtop.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the components of the base URL of the Webtop instance you want to use for serving the documents.  Remember that this information will only be used to construct
                    a URL to the document to allow user inspection; it will not be used for any crawling activities.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button.  When you do, a connection summary and status screen will be presented:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Documentum Connection Status" src="images/documentum-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Pay careful attention to the status, and be prepared to correct any
                    problems that are displayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A job created to use a Documentum connection has the following additional tabs associated with it: "Paths", "Document Types", "Content Types", "Security", and "Path Metadata".</p>
<p>The "Paths" tab allows you to construct the paths within Documentum that you want to scan for content.  If no paths are selected, all content will be considered eligible.</p>
<p>The "Document Types" tab allows you to select what document types you want to index.  Only document types that are derived from dm_document, which are flagged by the system administrator
                    as being "indexable", will be presented for your selection.  On this tab also, for each document type you index, you may choose included specific metadata for documents of that type, or you can
                    check the "All metadata" checkbox to include all metadata associated with documents of that type.</p>
<p>The "Content Types" tab allows you to select which Documentum mime-types are to be included in the document set.  Check the types you want to include, and uncheck the types you want to
                    exclude.</p>
<p>The "Security" tab allows you to disable or enable Documentum security for the documents described by this job.  You can turn off native Documentum security by clicking the "Disable" radio button.
                    If you do this, you may also enter your own access tokens, which will be applied to all documents described by the job.  The form of the access tokens you enter will depend on the governing
                    authority connection type.  Click the "Add" button to add each access token.</p>
<p>The "Path Metadata" tab allows you to send each document's path information as metadata to the index.  To enable this feature, enter the name of the metadata
                    attribute you want this information to be sent into the "Path attribute name" field.  Then, add the rules you want to the list of rules.  Each rule has a match expression, which is a regular expression where
                    parentheses ("(" and ")") mark sections you are interested in.  These sections are called "groups" in regular expression parlance.  The replace string consists of constant text plus
                    substitutions of the groups from the match, perhaps modified.  For example, "$(1)" refers to the first group within the match, while "$(1l)" refers to the first match group
                    mapped to lower case.  Similarly, "$(1u)" refers to the same characters, but mapped to upper case.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had a rule which had ".*/(.*)/(.*)/.*" as a match expression, and "$(1) $(2)" as the replace string.  If presented with the path
                    <span class="codefrag">Project/Folder_1/Folder_2/Filename</span>, it would output the string <span class="codefrag">Folder_1 Folder_2</span>.</p>
<p>If more than one rule is present, the rules are all executed in sequence.  That is, the output of the first rule is modified by the second rule, etc.</p>

<h3 class="h4">OpenText LiveLink Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The OpenText LiveLink connection type allows you to index content from LiveLink repositories.  LiveLink has a rich variety of different document types and metadata, which include
                    basic documents, as well as compound documents, folders, workspaces, and projects.  A LiveLink connection is able to discover documents contained within all of these constructs.</p>
<p>Documents described by LiveLink connections are typically secured by a LiveLink authority.  If you have not yet created a LiveLink authority, but would like your
                    documents to be secured, please follow the direction in the section titled "OpenText LiveLink Authority Connection".</p>
<p>A LiveLink connection has the following special tabs: "Server", "Document Access", and "Document View".  The "Server" tab allows you to select a LiveLink server to connect to, and also to provide
                    appropriate credentials.  The "Document Access" tab describes the location of the LiveLink web interface, relative to the server, that will be used to fetch document content from LiveLink.
                    The "Document View" tab affects how URLs to the fetched documents are constructed, for viewing results of searches.</p>
<p>The "Server" tab looks like this:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>The server name is presumed to be the same as is on the "Server" tab.  Select the desired protocol.  If your LiveLink server is using a non-standard HTTP port for the specified protocol, enter the 
                    port number.  If your LiveLink server is using NTLM authentication, enter an AD user name, password, and domain.  If your LiveLink is using HTTPS, browse locally for the appropriate
                    certificate authority certificate, and click "Add" to upload that certificate to the connection's trust store.  (You may also use the server's certificate, but that is less resilient because the
                    server's certificate may be changed periodically.)</p>
<p>The "Document View" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Connection, Document Viewtab" src="images/livelink-connection-document-view.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you want each document's view URL to be the same as its access URL, you can leave this tab unchanged.  If you want to direct users to a different CGI path when they view search results,
                    you can specify that here.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button.  You will see a summary screen that looks something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Connection Status" src="images/livelink-connection-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Make note of and correct any reported connection errors.  In this example, the connection has been correctly set up, so the connection status is "Connection working".</p>
<p></p>
<p>A job created to use a LiveLink connection has the following additional tabs associated with it: "Paths", "Filters", "Security", and "Metadata".</p>
<p>The "Paths" tab allows you to manage a list of LiveLink paths that act as starting points for indexing content:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Job, Paths tab" src="images/livelink-job-paths.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Build each path by selecting from the available dropdown, and clicking the "+" button.  When your path is complete, click the "Add" button to add the path to the list of starting points.</p>
<p>The "Filters" tab controls the criteria the LiveLink job will use to include or exclude content.  The filters are basically a list of rules.  Each rule has a document match field,
                    and a matching action ("Include" or "Exclude").  When a LiveLink connection encounters a document, it evaluates the rules from top to bottom.
                    If the rule matches, then it will be included or excluded from the job's document set depending on what you have selected for the matching action. A rule's match field specifies a
                    character match, where "*" will match any number of characters, and "?" will match any single character.</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Job, Filters tab" src="images/livelink-job-filters.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the match field value, select the match action, and click the "Add" button to add to the list of filters.</p>
<p>The "Security" tab allows you to disable (or enable) LiveLink security for the documents associated with this job:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Job, Security tab" src="images/livelink-job-security.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you disable security, you can add your own access tokens to all
                    jobs in the document set as they are indexed.  The format of the access tokens you would enter depends on the governing authority associated with the job's repository connection.
                    Enter a token and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.</p>
<p>The "Metadata" tab allows you to select what specific metadata values from LiveLink you want to pass to the index:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="LiveLink Job, Metadata tab" src="images/livelink-job-metadata.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you want to pass all available LiveLink metadata to the index, then click the "All metadata" radio button.  Otherwise, you need to build LiveLink metadata paths and add them to the metadata list.
                    Select the next metadata path segment, and click the appropriate "+" button to add it to the path.  You may add folder information, or a metadata category, at any point.</p>
<p>Once you have drilled down to a metadata category, you can select the metadata attributes to include, or check the "All attributes in this category" checkbox.  When you are done, click the
                    "Add" button to add the metadata attributes that you want to include in the index.</p>
<p>You can also use the "Metadata" tab to have the connection send path data along with each document, as a piece of document metadata.  To enable this feature, enter the name of the metadata
                    attribute you want this information to be sent into the "Path attribute name" field.  Then, add the rules you want to the list of rules.  Each rule has a match expression, which is a regular expression where
                    parentheses ("(" and ")") mark sections you are interested in.  These sections are called "groups" in regular expression parlance.  The replace string consists of constant text plus
                    substitutions of the groups from the match, perhaps modified.  For example, "$(1)" refers to the first group within the match, while "$(1l)" refers to the first match group
                    mapped to lower case.  Similarly, "$(1u)" refers to the same characters, but mapped to upper case.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had a rule which had ".*/(.*)/(.*)/.*" as a match expression, and "$(1) $(2)" as the replace string.  If presented with the path
                    <span class="codefrag">Project/Folder_1/Folder_2/Filename</span>, it would output the string <span class="codefrag">Folder_1 Folder_2</span>.</p>
<p>If more than one rule is present, the rules are all executed in sequence.  That is, the output of the first rule is modified by the second rule, etc.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Memex Patriarch Repository Connection</h3>
<p>A Memex Patriarch connection allows you to index documents from a Memex server.</p>
<p>Documents described by Memex connections are typically secured by a Memex authority.  If you have not yet created a Memex authority, but would like your
                    documents to be secured, please follow the direction in the section titled "Memex Patriarch Authority Connection".</p>
<p>A Memex connection has the following special tabs on the repository connection editing screen: the "Memex Server" tab, and the "Web Server" tab.  The "Memex Server" tab
                    looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Memex Connection, Memex Server tab" src="images/memex-connection-memex-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>You must supply the name of your Memex server, and the connection port, along with the Memex credentials for a user that has sufficient permissions to retrieve Memex
                    documents.  You must also select the Memex server's character encoding, and timezone.  If you do not know the encoding or timezone, consult your Memex system administrator.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Autonomy Meridio Repository Connection</h3>
<p>An Autonomy Meridio connection allows you to index documents from a set of Meridio servers.  Meridio's architecture allows you to separate services on multiple machines -
                    e.g. the document services can run on one machine, and the records services can run on another.  A Meridio connection type correspondingly is configured to describe each
                    Meridio service independently.</p>
<p>Documents described by Meridio connections are typically secured by a Meridio authority.  If you have not yet created a Meridio authority, but would like your
                    documents to be secured, please follow the direction in the section titled "Autonomy Meridio Authority Connection".</p>
<p>A Meridio connection has the following special tabs on the repository connection editing screen: the "Document Server" tab, the "Records Server" tab, the "Web Client" tab,
                    and the "Credentials" tab.  The "Document Server" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Meridio Connection, Document Server tab" src="images/meridio-connection-document-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the correct protocol, and enter the correct server name, port, and location to reference the Meridio document server services.  If a proxy is involved, enter the proxy host
                    and port.  Authenticated proxies are not supported by this connection type at this time.</p>
<p>Note that, in the Meridio system, while it is possible that different services run on different servers, this is not typically the case.  The connection type, on the other hand, makes
                    no assumptions, and permits the most general configuration.</p>
<p>The "Records Server" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Meridio Connection, Records Server tab" src="images/meridio-connection-records-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the correct protocol, and enter the correct server name, port, and location to reference the Meridio records server services.  If a proxy is involved, enter the proxy host
                    and port.  Authenticated proxies are not supported by this connection type at this time.</p>
<p>Note that, in the Meridio system, while it is possible that different services run on different servers, this is not typically the case.  The connection type, on the other hand, makes
                    no assumptions, and permits the most general configuration.</p>
<p>The "Web Client" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Meridio Connection, Web Client tab" src="images/meridio-connection-web-client.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The purpose of the Meridio Connection web client tab is to allow the connection to build a useful URL for each document it indexes.
                    Select the correct protocol, and enter the correct server name, port, and location to reference the Meridio web client service.  No proxy information is required, as no documents
                    will be fetched from this service.</p>
<p>The "Credentials" tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Meridio Connection, Credentials tab" src="images/meridio-connection-credentials.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enter the Meridio server credentials needed to access the Meridio system.</p>
<p>When you are done, click the "Save" button to save the connection.  You will see a summary screen, looking something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="Meridio Connection Status" src="images/meridio-connection-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note that in this example, the Meridio connection is not actually correctly configured, which is leading to an error status message instead of "Connection working".</p>
<p>Since Meridio uses Windows IIS for authentication, there are many ways in which the configuration of either IIS or the Windows domain under which Meridio runs can affect
                    the correct functioning of the Meridio connection.  It is beyond the scope of this manual to describe the kinds of analysis and debugging techniques that might be required to diagnose connection
                    and authentication problems.  If you have trouble, you will almost certainly need to involve your Meridio IT personnel.  Debugging tools may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Windows security event logs</li>
                    
<li>ManifoldCF logs (see below)</li>
                    
<li>Packet captures (using a tool such as WireShark)</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>If you need specific ManifoldCF logging information, contact your system integrator.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Microsoft SharePoint Repository Connection</h3>
<p>The Microsoft SharePoint connection type allows you to index documents from a Microsoft SharePoint site.  Bear in mind that a single SharePoint installation actually represents
                    a set of sites.  Some sites
                    in SharePoint are directly related to others (e.g. they are subsites), while some sites operate relatively independently of one another.</p>
<p>The SharePoint connection type is designed so that one SharePoint repository connection can access all SharePoint sites from a specific root site though its explicit subsites.
                    It is the case
                    that it is desirable in some very large SharePoint installations to access <b>all</b> SharePoint sites using a single connection.  But the ManifoldCF SharePoint connection type today
                    does not support
                    that model as of yet.  If this functionality is important for you, contact your system integrator.</p>
<p>SharePoint uses a web URL model for addressing sites, subsites, libraries, and files.  The best way to figure out how to set up a SharePoint connection type is therefore to start
                    with your web browser,
                    and visit the root of the site you wish to crawl.  Then, record the URL you see in your browser.</p>
<p>Documents described by SharePoint connections are typically secured by an Active Directory authority.  If you have not yet created your Active Directory authority, but would like
                    your documents to be secured, please follow the direction in the section titled "Active Directory Authority Connection".</p>
<p>A SharePoint connection has one special tab on the repository connection editing screen: the "Server" tab, which looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="SharePoint Connection, Server tab" src="images/sharepoint-configure-server.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select your SharePoint server version from the pulldown.  If you do not select the correct server version, your documents may either be indexed with insufficient security protection,
                    or you
                    may not be able to index any documents.  Check with your SharePoint system administrator if you are not sure what to select.</p>
<p>Select the server protocol, and enter the server name and port, based on what you recorded from the URL for your SharePoint site.  For the "Site path" field, type in the portion of the
                    root site URL that includes everything after the server and port, except for the final "aspx" file.  For example, if the SharePoint URL is "http://myserver:81/sites/somewhere/index.asp",
                    the site path would be "/sites/somewhere".</p>
<p>The SharePoint credentials are, of course, what you used to log into your root site.  The SharePoint connection type always requires the user name to be in the form "domain\user".</p>
<p>If your SharePoint server is using SSL, you will need to supply enough certificates for the connection's trust store so that the SharePoint server's SSL server certificate
                    can be validated.  This typically consists of either the server certificate, or the certificate from the authority that signed the server certificate.  Browse to the local file containing the
                    certificate, and click the "Add" button.</p>
<p>After you click the "Save" button, you will see a connection summary screen, which might look something like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="SharePoint Status" src="images/sharepoint-status.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note that in this example, the SharePoint connection is not actually referencing a SharePoint instance, which is leading to an error status message instead of "Connection working".</p>
<p>Since SharePoint uses Windows IIS for authentication, there are many ways in which the configuration of either IIS or the Windows domain under which SharePoint runs can affect
                    the correct functioning of the SharePoint connection.  It is beyond the scope of this manual to describe the kinds of analysis and debugging techniques that might be required to diagnose connection
                    and authentication problems.  If you have trouble, you will almost certainly need to involve your SharePoint IT personnel.  Debugging tools may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<br>
<ul>
                    
<li>Windows security event logs</li>
                    
<li>ManifoldCF logs (see below)</li>
                    
<li>Packet captures (using a tool such as WireShark)</li>
                
</ul>
<br>
<p>If you need specific ManifoldCF logging information, contact your system integrator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you configure a job to use a repository connection of the generic database type, several additional tabs are presented.  These are, in order, "Paths", "Security", and "Metadata".</p>
<p>The "Paths" tab allows you to build a list of rules describing the SharePoint content that you want to include in your job.  When the SharePoint connection type encounters a subsite,
                    library, or file, it looks through this list of rules to determine whether to include the subsite, library, or file.  The first matching rule will determine what will be done.</p>
<p>Each rule consists of a path, a rule type, and an action.  The actions are "Include" and "Exclude".  The rule type tells the connection what kind of SharePoint entity it is allowed to exactly match.  For
                    example, a "File" rule will only exactly match SharePoint paths that represent files - it cannot exactly match sites or libraries.  The path itself is just a sequence of characters, where the "*" character
                    has the special meaning of being able to match any number of any kind of characters, and the "?" character matches exactly one character of any kind.</p>
<p>The rule matcher extends strict, exact matching by introducing a concept of implicit inclusion rules.  If your rule action is "Include", and you specify (say) a "File" rule, the matcher presumes
                    implicit inclusion rules for the corresponding site and library.  So, if you create an "Include File" rule that matches (for example) "/MySite/MyLibrary/MyFile", there is an implied "Site Include" rule
                    for "/MySite", and an implied "Library Include" rule for "/MySite/MyLibrary".  Similarly, if you create a "Library Include" rule, there is an implied "Site Include" rule that corresponds to it.
                    Note that these shortcuts only applies to "Include" rules - there are no corresponding implied "Exclude" rules.</p>
<p>The "Paths" tab allows you to build these rules one at a time, and add them either to the bottom of the list, or insert them into the list of rules at any point.  Either way, you construct the rule
                    you want to append or insert by first constructing the path, from left to right, using your choice of text and context-dependent pulldowns with existing server path information listed.  This is what the tab
                    may look like for you.  Bear in mind that if you are using a connection that does not display the status, "Connection working", you may not see the selections you should in these pulldowns:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="SharePoint Job, Paths tab" src="images/sharepoint-job-paths.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>To build a rule, first build the rule's matching path.  Make an appropriate selection or enter desired text, then click either the "Add Site", "Add Library", or "Add Text" button, depending on your choice.
                    Repeat this process until the path is what you want it to be.  At this point, if the SharePoint connection does not know what kind of entity your path describes, you will need to select the
                    SharePoint entity type that you want the rule to match also.  Select whether this is an include or exclude rule.  Then, click the "Add New Rule" button, to add your newly-constructed rule
                    at the end of the list.</p>
<p>The "Security" tab allows you to specify whether SharePoint's security model should be applied to this set of documents, or not.  You also have the option of applying some specified set of access
                    tokens to the documents described by the job.  The tab looks like this:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="SharePoint Job, Security tab" src="images/sharepoint-job-security.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select whether SharePoint security is on or off using the radio buttons provided.  If security is off, you may add access tokens in the text box and click the "Add" button.  The access tokens must
                    be in the proper form expected by the authority that governs your SharePoint connection for this feature to be useful.</p>
<p>The "Metadata" tab allows you to specify what metadata will be included for each document.  The tab is similar to the "Paths" tab, which you may want to review above:</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="" style="text-align: center;">
<img id="" class="figure" alt="SharePoint Job, Security tab" src="images/sharepoint-job-metadata.PNG" width="80%"></div>
<br>
<br>
<p>The main difference is that instead of rules that include or exclude individual sites, libraries, or documents, the rules describe inclusion and exclusion of document metadata.  Since metadata is associated
                    with files, all of the metadata rules are applied only to file paths, and there are no such things as "site" or "library" metadata path rules.</p>
<p>If an exclusion rule matches a file's path, it means that <b>no</b> metadata from that file will be included at all.  There is no way to individually exclude a single field using an exclusion rule.</p>
<p>To build a rule, first build the rule's matching path.  Make an appropriate selection or enter desired text, then click either the "Add Site", "Add Library", or "Add Text" button, depending on your choice.
                    Repeat this process until the path is what you want it to be.  Select whether this is an include or exclude rule.  Either check the box for "Include all metadata", or select the metadata you want to include
                    from the pulldown.  (The choices of metadata fields you are presented with are determined by which SharePoint library is selected.  If your rule path does not uniquely specify a library, you cannot select individual
                    fields to include.  You can only select "All metadata".)  Then, click the "Add New Rule" button, to put your newly-constructed rule
                    at the end of the list.</p>
<p>You can also use the "Metadata" tab to have the connection send path data along with each document, as a piece of document metadata.  To enable this feature, enter the name of the metadata
                    attribute you want this information to be sent into the "Attribute name" field.  Then, add the rules you want to the list of rules.  Each rule has a match expression, which is a regular expression where
                    parentheses ("(" and ")") mark sections you are interested in.  These sections are called "groups" in regular expression parlance.  The replace string consists of constant text plus
                    substitutions of the groups from the match, perhaps modified.  For example, "$(1)" refers to the first group within the match, while "$(1l)" refers to the first match group
                    mapped to lower case.  Similarly, "$(1u)" refers to the same characters, but mapped to upper case.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had a rule which had ".*/(.*)/(.*)/.*" as a match expression, and "$(1) $(2)" as the replace string.  If presented with the path
                    <span class="codefrag">Project/Folder_1/Folder_2/Filename</span>, it would output the string <span class="codefrag">Folder_1 Folder_2</span>.</p>
<p>If more than one rule is present, the rules are all executed in sequence.  That is, the output of the first rule is modified by the second rule, etc.</p>
