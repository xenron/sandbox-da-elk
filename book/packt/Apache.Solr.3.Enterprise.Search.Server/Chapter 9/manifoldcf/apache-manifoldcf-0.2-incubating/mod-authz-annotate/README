mod_authz_annotate is used to populate the incoming request with headers
containing the authorizations of the authenticated user.  It will also
authorize the request, rejecting it with a 401 based on the configured 
authority services.

The authorizations are inserted to the headers as:

AAAUSR:<specific identification of the user>
	There will be only one of these.

AAAGRP:<grouping that user is member of>
	There can be many of these.

The module is configured with the following directives:

AuthzAnnotateEnable [On|Off]
    Toggle state of authority feature

AuthzAnnotateAuthority URL
    URL of an authority service as defined below.  The configured service
    will be asked for ACLs but no ID.

AuthzAnnotateACLAuthority URL
    URL of an authority service as defined below.  The configured service
    will be asked for ACLs but no ID.

AuthzAnnotateIDAuthority URL
    URL of an authority service as defined below.  The configured service
    will be asked for an ID but no ACLs.

AuthzAnnotateIDACLAuthority URL
    URL of an authority service as defined below.  The configured service
    will be asked for noth IDs AND ACLs.

The XXXAuthority directives may be repeated and/or mixed and matched so a
single configuration can query multiple authorities.  When multiple
auhtorities are configured:

TODO!!!

The source of the authorizations are authority services, which are HTTP
services that take CGI-like parameters in the URL and return ID/TOKEN lists.

The configured URLs can be anything and will be augmented as follows:

http://CONFIGUREDURL[?|&]
	username=asdf
	[idneeded=true|false]
	[aclneeded=true|false]

The ?|& will be added depending of whether the configured URL has CGI-like
parmaters already or not.

The username paramaters is *always* appended. 

The idneeded and aclneeded paramaters are also currently always appended,
but the services should be OK with those not being present.

Order of these parameters is not guaranteed.All parameters values will be
properly URL-encoded.


ID:
TOKEN:

"UNAUTHORIZED"
"NOTFOUND"
"OK"
